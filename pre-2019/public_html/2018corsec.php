											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 	OYFA has become more than just a place for friendships to flourish. 
												It has also become a place for advocacy, a place for culture, and a place for encouragement. 
												I ran for this position in order to become a part of that. I wanted to not only create a space 
												for others to feel welcomed but also empowered. This position gave me an outlet to embody what 
												it means to be a young Filipino-American in a society that has yet to acknowledge our strong influence. 
												I ran because I wanted to be able to encourage the members to showcase the importance of Filipino culture 
												and our presence as Asian-Americans.
