												<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?
</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											   My favorite OYFA memory so far is Sports Day during Family Week. It got me closer to so many members, and I was thrilled to be able to complete and have some fun while getting to know what OYFA is all about, which is family!

												<h3>If you were stuck in an Island and could only eat one food the entire time, what would you choose?
</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											 Anything at Taco Bell. I would hope that my island would at least have some Taco Bell. It’s rated the healthiest fast food chain too so I wouldn’t have to worry eating it for the rest of my life.

											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											OYFA sports gave me some of my favorite first year memories, from Family Week Field Day to playing IMs to Winter Classic and more. Brandon and Sarah created an environment in which I felt comfortable being myself but also encouraged me to try things beyond my comfort zone. Sports was my outlet for finding my place in OYFA. I am so excited to see how I can give back to OYFA members in this position, hope that Atman and I can maintain the spirit of traditional OYFA sports events as well as come up with some fun new ones!

											<h3>If you were given the AUX, which song would you play?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											If I were given the AUX, I would play "Emoticons" by The Wombats. I am always the last to volunteer to AUX, because honestly I inherited my mixed interest in music from my sister. "Emoticons" is one of those cheesy songs that you play during late-night drives with all the windows down. It gives me really happy memories because the first time I heard it was after a perfect day spent with my sister, and it was one of the last no-stress days we had near the end of one summer. This is the best feel-good song.

												<h3>Favorite class at UVA and why?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											    My favorite class at UVA was one I took second semester of first year called Feminism and Fiction. It was an English literature class that was taught by a professor that I have taken to as my mentor. I loved this class because 1) I loved all the assigned readings and have even gone on to read other books by some of those authors and 2) the discussions we had in class were some of the best I have ever heard and participated in about touchy and somewhat controversial subjects. We did everything from politics to racism to inequality to feminism in all forms and subjects in between. I met some awesome people in that class too.

												<h3> What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											   My favorite OYFA memory was the rehearsal the night before my first Barrio. Alexa and Hayden had always hyped up the whole thing for me, but seeing and experiencing it for myself was incredible. Everyone put in blood, sweat, and tears for last year's Barrio and seeing it all come together for the first time was indescribable. Also, as part of the cast for the play, and having spent many hours perfecting the lines and facial expressions and chemistry for my character, it was so fun seeing how everyone reacted to what they saw. Plus, when all the alumni came in, the whole room just exploded in a way I've never seen before. It was an absolutely irreplaceable night and it ensured that I will be more and more excited for night-before-Barrio rehearsals for the next few years.
