											 I'll put two. During my first year Barrio, we were scrambling to find a practice location for the last practice. We all ended up in the bandroom (thanks to Marc Guzman) and we watched UVA basketball play. There was such an incredible spirit that night which carried over to our practices. The other favorite memory was my second year as culture. I handled the last Culturefest practice and it felt good knowing I was supporting the then-babies.

											 I really want to be part of the academic scene of oyfa and help first years with the tools and resources needed to be successful

										<p>
											 My favorite class at UVA is Gender in the Middle East and it is part of the anthropology
											 department! I had never taken any class that was completely based on discussion. It was 
											 super interesting because the class was taught through selected readings which offered more
											 authentic and controversial opinions. These readings made the discussions more heated yet also 
											 allowed the class to grow class making me excited every time I walked into the room.

											My favorite OYFA memory was Halo-Haloween night! I remember it was towards the beginning
											of the year and I was able to bond with other first years because we were all scared of horror movies! 
											It was also an event that showcased Filipino culture with halo-halo which is a really famous Filipino dessert.

											   I'm not sure if everyone knows this already but I love tofu! Not the one that they serve at the salad bar though.
											   I prefer fried tofu. And tofu is such a flexible food because you can add your own sauces to make it taste 
											   the way you want it to. Also I'm a vegetarian so I don't have that many options to choose from.

											 I decided to run for Scholarship because I want to help legitimize the academic aspects of OYFA.
