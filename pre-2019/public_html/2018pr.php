											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 Since I was young, I've been very interested in art and design. Being able
											 to create meaningful designs that help others find and make a home in our organization is very important to me.

											<h3>What is one goal you want to accomplish by the end of the year?
											</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											By the end of the year, I really want to create a specific brand for OYFA. 
											I want someone to be able to look at a design and know that its OYFA. I think
											that implementing who OYFA is and our values will be really important in establishing our brand.

											<h3>Favorite class at UVA and why?
</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
										My favorite class at UVA so far has been Literature of Fantasy. 
										Being an engineering major, I take a lot of technical and math based classes. 
										I loved Literature of Fantasy because it allowed me to take a couple hours each week 
										and envelope myself in an entirely different world where I didn't have to worry about beam deflection or heat flow.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?
											</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 My favorite OYFA memory is when I first became a little.
											 I remember I wasn't sure of what to expect, but my bigs made me feel at home right away and treated me like family.

											<h3>If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?
											</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
												If I could have any superpower, it would be teleportation. 
												That way I could sleep in an extra 10 minutes before classes, drastically improving my sleep schedule.

											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 Since I'm in e-school, I wanted an opportunity to break away from STEM for a bit
											 to have a creative outlet and contribute to the multicultural community at UVA. I also
											 wanted to have a leadership position that would allow me to connect with the incoming class and offer 
											 advice that I would've wanted coming into college!

											<h3>If you were given the AUX, which song would you play?
											</h3>

										<p>
											I would play Sweatpants by Childish Gambino, because it's one 
											of the few things I can rap all the way through and it kept me hype through finals.
