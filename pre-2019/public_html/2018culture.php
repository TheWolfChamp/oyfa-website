										<p>
											  As middle school me would say.. FILIPINO PRIDE. 
											  I wanted to showcase all the little intricacies of 
											  filipino culture, from chinelas to mano po. And I 
											  saw culture as a way to promote all of that. I also 
											  saw the bonds Culturefest and Barrio have made between
											  the members of OYFA and wanted to help making everyone's experience the best it can be!

										<p>
													I first got really involved with OYFA through Culturefest 
													in my first year. In the past two years I truly enjoyed 
													learning about and appreciating Filipino culture as a part
													of being in organization. Because I had such fun bonding experiences 
													through dance practices, I wanted to make sure future babies and OYFA 
													in general are make the same great memories.
