						<p>
						<b>1. Why did you decide to run for this board position?</b><br>
									I wanted to run for president because after being on board and council, I have seen the transformation of many of our members into leaders and ambitious individuals because of this organization.  The collaboration and camaraderie OYFA encourages in the UVA community is vital for its growth and it really inspired me to become president.	
						<p>
						<b>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</b><br>
								Food Fight my third year is my favorite OYFA memory.  The spirit and excitement that my family brought was awesome.  It was my first year as a family head and even though my family was one of the smaller ones, I never stopped laughing while I was with them. (Yay Tala!) </p>						
						<p>
						<b>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</b><br>
								I'm looking forward to meeting all the babies and getting closer our members.  A new class brings new personalities and fresh excitement for OYFA and I love that time of the year.						
						<p>
						<b>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</b><br>
								I would want to be Salem Saberhagen, who is the black cat from Sabrina the Teenage Witch.  He is witty, full of one-liners, and lives such a carefree life being a cat.  He also happens to have magical powers so I could shape-shift and teleport if I want to, which would be really convenient.  Even though he is evil and wants to take over the world, if you ignore that part, he is a perfect fit for me.

						<p>
						<b>1. Why did you decide to run for this board position?</b><br>
								OYFA has been pivotal to my college experience and I wanted to serve the organization in a way I felt appropriate. With previous board experience, I felt that I could run for this position and am honored to serve as vice president for the 2015-2016 school year.
						<p>
						<b>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</b><br>
								This is a pretty hard question (I kind of don't want to give a generic response) but I guess I'll go with a smaller memory (that's not Barrio or bigger events). I really enjoyed the karaoke night at Kuma this past year! It was a lot of fun and a great time spent with my OYFAmily. </p>						
						<p>
						<b>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</b><br>
								I look forward to a lot but I certainly anticipate introducing OYFA to a new class as well as any individual whose interested in joining the organization. Furthermore, I would really like to keep our current members active as well as keep our alumni connected within our organization!					
						<p>
						<b>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</b><br>
								If I could be any character from TV, I would be Fiona Goode (the Supreme) from American Horror Story: Coven. I adore Jessica Lange.

						<b>1. Why did you decide to run for this board position?</b><br>
								After serving as D7 Rep this past year I developed an appreciation for the "bigger picture" and a passion for outreach to people beyond our OYFAm. I thought, how better to serve OYFA than to be Treasurer, one of the people that reaches out to get others to help to make each event happen. I am also excited to take on more responsibility as a member of Board and a family head! While I'm sure I still have a lot to learn, I cannot wait for where another year with OYFA will take me! :D
						<p>
						<b>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</b><br>
								One of my favorite OYFA memories has to be my first performance with OYFA at Go Global Expo 2013 (most other years the first performance is Culturefest). It pushed me out of my comfort zone to try something new, and the dance practices also served as bonding time to get to know other new OYFAns better. It was definitely a challenge for me (#strugz) but in the end the hard work paid off and I'll never forget the feeling I had after performing it on stage with my OYFAm. But also: Beach Week 2k14 and 2k15. 'Nuff said. </p>						
						<p>
						<b>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</b><br>
								I look forward to meeting/seeing all the members of OYFA--either for the first time or again--and watching them grow. College is a time for first experiences and I believe that no matter how big or small of a label an experience might have, each of them play their role in shaping our character. While we may have little say over what our experiences might be, we do decide how we let them affect us and whether or not we learn from them.				
						<p>
						<b>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</b><br>
								Clarke from "The 100" on the CW, but hopefully with less life or death situations. She has to make some tough decisions and you can see her character growth and development even if you don't always agree with her decisions. Not to mention she gets with the hottest characters (#Clexa4ever) and is pretty badass herself.

						<p>
						<b>1. Why did you decide to run for this board position?</b><br>
								Being Corresponding secretary is a great opportunity to help support and guide OYFA after being involved in it for so long. I think it's fun to play a part in managing all the behind the scenes work and all the planning that goes into being on Board. My job is to not only organize all the room bookings and technical details for events, but I'm also in charge of the Fall Symposium, which I'm super exited to plan and execute! 
						<p>
						<b>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</b><br>
								There are so many memories to choose from, but I absolutely loved my first Night Before Barrio and Barrio. Not saying I didn't like the other ones, including my own as Culture, but there's something special and amazing seeing everything and everyone come together like it did the first time and all the traditions that are embedded in it. That energy circle though. </p>						
						<p>
						<b>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</b><br>
								One OYFAn who had a big impact on me said that their fourth year was the by far the best, so I'm definitely hype for all of it! I'm probably most excited for Fourth Year Modern in our last Barrio. There are certain rules that kind of have to be followed in First Year Modern and Megamodern, but this time the sky's the limit and hopefully 2016 can deliver!		
						<p>
						<b>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</b><br>
								Honestly, I'd never want to be anyone else, but I would so love to either be in the Harry Potter or Avatar: The Last Airbender universe because I would freaking love to be a wizard or a bender. I'd be happy with either one (can I be both?!).

								I ran for this position because I love OYFA and I wanted to contribute to the organization that has given so much to me! I also want to use the WIO to keep all of us informed and connected in new and interesting ways. 
						<p>
						<b>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</b><br>
								My favorite OYFA memory so far was messing up real bad on stage during Barrio and hearing someone laugh at me.  </p>						
						<p>
						<b>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</b><br>
								I look forward to every Sunday night when I send out the WIO. 
						<p>
						<b>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</b><br>
								Aang from Avatar the Last Airbender because, if you really think about it, you can do anything if you can control all the elements. Literally anything. Wow.
