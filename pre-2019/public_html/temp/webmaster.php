			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
Being a part of OYFA was a great experience during my first year. With this position, I can continue my involvement but at a deeper level. This position also gives me an opportunity to learn about how websites work (knowledge that I believe is pretty useful nowadays).			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
Dancing was pretty fun! Adding to that is being able to meet various people: from different personalities to different ethnicities. OYFA is a group that captures this diversity very well. I joined a little late and I was still able to create important, memorable friendships that I consider highly valuable :)  			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
		I am passionate about learning new things, specifically learning interesting things about how the universe works (a bit nerdy ;) haha). So don't let my major trick you! I find many topics besides Comp Sci interesting. One of the coolest facts that I've ever learned is by wondering where the ingeredients of our bodies (the atoms that comprise it) originated from. Turns out, they came from massive explosions of dying stars (like Supernovae) : &#8220;The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.&#8221; - Carl Sagan			<br>
		<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
			To have a Timelord body like the Doctor's from the show Doctor Who. I could just regenerate when I feel old, come out with a fresh new look, and continue to embark on new adventures!
