			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
I wanted to be FIND chair because I wanted to meet people from other schools in Filipino organizations and help give OYFA opportunities to do so.			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
I love the people I've met in OYFA! This organization is full of so many fun and inspiring people, and it's awesome to call them my friends :) 			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
My passion is dance. When I'm not in class or studying, you'll probably find me in O'Hill Forum or one of the gyms dancing with AKAdeMiX or Xtasee, two of the best hip hops crews on Grounds! I've been dancing since I was 8, in hip hop, ballet, tap, and jazz. I also choreograph for OYFA! :)			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
If I had a superpower, I would have control over force fields, telekinesis, and telepathy :)

			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
I wanted to become OYFA&#39;s representative in FIND because I believe it is important to build a network beyond UVA. Sometimes being on Grounds allows me to forget that the world is so much larger than the UVA community, and having the opportunity to leave Cville (as beautiful as it is) shocks me back into the reality of how much more there is out there. As FIND rep not only do I get to build my network and make new friends from other places, but I also get to bridge the connection from OYFA at UVA to other Filipino organizations at other schools. (And my cochair&#39;s aiiight, I guess.)			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
OYFA hosts a variety of events that range from academic to social to charitable and even more. Nonetheless, my favorite thing about OYFA would have to be the people I met and call my friends because they are ultimately what makes my experience at UVA so memorable. I always enjoy spending time with them whether it&#39;s studying, ordering pizza, watching movies, or sleeping.
			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
I am passionate about diversity. I enjoy being around people that come from a variety of cultures because it brings enlightening new ideas and a variety of personalities to create a melting pot community. People from different backgrounds with different involvements can still share ideals and opinions, or have an open minded discussion about a variety of topics and discover how much they have in common despite initial superficial differences.
			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
I would love to have the ability to shapeshift simply because there are so many fun things I could do. For example I could turn into a bird and fly around to see grounds from a cool new height. Or I could turn into a pen and stalk one of my friends for an entire day from their pocket. Or I could become a squirrel and snatch people&#39;s food when they aren&#39;t looking. There are endless possibilities.			</div>
