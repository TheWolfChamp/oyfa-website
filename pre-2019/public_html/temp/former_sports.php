			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
One of my favorite things in the world is sports.  Running for sports chair would allow me to give back to OYFA while doing something I love.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
OYFA is a pretty cool group of people.  It's a close family but accepting of everyone.			
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
I really wanted to stay in state for college, and UVA just seemed like the perfect fit.  It was my top choice, and I haven't regretted the decision!			
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
If there was a movie about my life, I would have Adam Sandler play me.  He's absolutely hilarious and seems like a chill guy.
