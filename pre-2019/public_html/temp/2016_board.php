						<b> 1. Why did you decide to run for this position?</b><br>
								In addition to giving back to the organization that provided me with a family away from home, serving as President allows me a unique opportunity to make an impact on the community at UVA.
						<p>
						<b>	2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</b><br>
								The week of OYFAssassins my little and I were attached at the hip; he basically lived at my apartment for the entire week. Although we didn't win, we bonded and it made for funny stories later.
						<p>
						<b>	3. What did you eat today?</b><br>
								I had garlic bread, which I burnt in the toaster oven (how? idk), and pasta which I made too watery. As is evident, these past three years at UVA I have nearly perfected my kitchen skills.
						<p>
						<b>	4. Describe your perfect day</b><br>
								A day with no work, plenty of food, some Netflix, and my closest friends.

						<p>
						<b>1. Why did you decide to run for this board position?</b><br>
								I ran for VP because I wanted to challenge myself. After holding two very different positions, I thought my experience would be helpful to both Board and Council. I wanted to see how I could use the skills I have learned and the experiences I have had so far at UVA to help guide the leaders of OYFA. 
						<p>
						<b>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</b><br>
								To me, OYFA means balance. When I first came to UVA, I really struggled finding a balance in life. In high school I kept myself busy with extracurriculars, but when I got to UVA I didn't know what to do with all my time. I didn't do well in school because I wasn't able to find a balance between work and play. I found a good group of friends in OYFA that helped me find this balance and learn how to manage my schedule. I was able to play sports, go to fun events, volunteer, AND learn about Filipino culture. Being in OYFA and holding leadership positions has really shaped by college experience, I feel like I would be very lost if I hadn't joined. </p>						
						<p>
						<b>3. Favorite class at UVA and why</b><br>
								Sociology of Self. I liked how Professor Dudaronak presented theories and the ones she chose to teach. We read many articles that were helpful in my major and I actually enjoyed learning about theory - woah. 				
						<p>
						<b>4. Describe your perfect day</b><br>
								Eating three meals in three different countries. I would want to wake up on an island in the Philippines, eat spam, eggs and rice, and lay on the beach and drink out of a coconut. I would want to have lunch in Italy and eat some good pasta and roam around. I would want to have a starry dinner on a rooftop in Paris,  where I could see the Eiffel tower and eat escargot (and other french food). Annnddd maybe end up at a dance club in Spain to learn how to salsa the night away.

						<p>
						<b>1. Why did you decide to run for this board position?</b><br>
								I ran for treasurer mainly because I love OYFA and I wanted to continue playing a role in its journey. My experience on Board this past year was great, so I knew it was something I wanted to keep on doing. 
						<p>
						<b>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</b><br>
								Probably Barrio this year was my favorite because being in Singkil was the coolest feeling and I tried harder for the modern dances so it was more fun and hype. I was screaming internally  the whole time but in a good way. </p>						
						<p>
						<b>3. What is something you are passionate about?</b><br>
								Clothes	
						<p>
						<b>4. If you could have any super power, what would it be and why?</b><br>
								Ability to freeze time because life would be so much easier. 	
						<p>
						<b>5. Would you like to be famous? For what reason?</b><br>
								Yes because you can make money for nothing and you get free things even though you're already rich.

						<p>
						<b>1. Why did you decide to run for this board position?</b><br>
								I spent the past year on council serving as sports chair and I felt  that running for board would give me an opportunity to give back to the organization I call my home. I wanted to work on my organizational skills and improve my communication skills, so the position of Corresponding Secretary was the most appealing to me. 
						<p>
						<b>2. What is your favorite OYFA merchandise?</b><br>
								Definitely the navy hoodie, I pretty much wear it all the time. </p>						
						<p>
						<b>3. What is something you are passionate about?</b><br>
								Basketball and League of Legends. Honestly if I were good enough at League I'd drop out of college and join a pro team in a heart beat, but alas I am not. I like league not because it's a fun video game, but because it is a sport (e-sport) that gives other people a chance to be in the spotlight. It allows people who weren't given the natural athletic ability to be in the center of the stage. As for basketball,  well ball is life. 
						<p>
						<b>4. Describe your perfect day</b><br>
								Wake up a little after 12, go to lunch with a group of friends. Play league for two or three hours, go to the AFC to play basketball, then a steak dinner with friends, and then a couple of games of Settlers of Catan.
