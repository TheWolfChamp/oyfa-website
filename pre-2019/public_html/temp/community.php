			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
I ran for the position of Community Co-Chair because I really enjoy volunteering and helping others. I have volunteered in various ways starting in high school. I wanted to keep volunteering in college and I believe that this position was a great opportunity for me to continue that. 			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
The best part about OYFA is the diversity. I have made so many friends from different backgrounds and stories and I believe that it has made me a better person. Not being filipino has given me a different experience in the club and I have loved that experience. 			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
I am passionate about the environment and protecting it. I chose to be an environmental science major after attending a governor's school based on environmental science. I learned a lot about the earth and how traditional practices are hurting it. I would love to take part in helping fix it. 			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
If I could have any superpower I would want to be able to walk through objects. I would be able to get places so much faster. I also would probably be able to get to class easier.

			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
Giving back to the community is something I genuinely love to do. To me, it's one of the most fulfilling ways to spend my time. I started volunteering back in high school and knew that I wanted to continue doing so in college. So during my first year, in addition to participating in OYFA events I spent a lot of time volunteering at elementary schools and the animal shelter. It only made sense to put both of them together and run for Community Chair!			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
OYFA is an incredibly multi-dimensional organization, which I didn't expect when I first joined. From potlucks to Global Expo to raising money for Typhoon Haiyan relief efforts, OYFA is so much more than a social organization. It's also a way for people to learn not only about Filipino culture, but also other cultures by getting to know non-Filipino members. 			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
Going to concerts! It's the greatest feeling hearing your favorite song performed live and being able to enjoy it with a crowd who feels exactly the same way. I've also gotten to meet some band members and that's always fun. It's super lucky that a lot of good music artists have been coming to Charlottesville recently, because I definitely miss being close to DC and having access to a ton of great concerts. 			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
Definitely teleportation, so I don't have to plan my life around the bus schedule. I'd also travel all the time, like casually go to Mexico during lunch for enchiladas. That'd be neat.			</div>
