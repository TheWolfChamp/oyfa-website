			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
						I ran for ISIP Chair for the following reasons: 1) another chance to give back to this amazing organization, 2) to advocate for our Filipino/Filipino-American heritage and culture, and 3) to promote awareness about current events happening around the world and within our community.<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
						I will never forget my first Barrio!!! That whole day was amazing filled with joyous memories! I had the honor of composing and conducting the Philippine National Anthem for OYFA's 25th anniversary as well as performing traditional Filipino dances. We all worked hard that day and were able to relax afterwards at the "After-Barrio Party!" ;D<br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
						I cannot wait for the arrival of the new OYFAn babies as well as the what they will bring to the table for this upcoming year! In addition, I can't wait to make more memories with my friends! Oh yeah! I ALSO can't wait to close my last year - here at the university - with Barrio Fiesta 2016!!! ~~Yayy~~ <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
						Hmm...that's a toughy. I'd say that it would be awesome if I was Michael the Archangel from the SyFy series "Dominion."

			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
						All the fun I have had with OYFA is rooted in and distinguished by its heritage.  It's important to celebrate and respect the culture that initially brought us all together.  <br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
						It's hard to say.  Watching the Filipino horror movie Feng Shui and trying halo-halo for the first time was what got me interested in running, but dancing for culture fest was really exciting and made me proud to be in OYFA. <br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
						I'm looking forward to dancing in Barrio, of course, and planning new events for ISIP.  They're a surprise though, so you'll have to wait and see! <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
						Sherlock's Irene Adler is pretty inspiring.
