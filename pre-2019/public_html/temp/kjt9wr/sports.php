			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
Since I'm in ROTC, I felt like I won't be able to do much as the years go by.  So in order to make up for it, I decided to run for something on Council, but the real question was: Which position should I run for?  Seeing how I enjoyed playing the IM's such as Football (and Soccer on the side) as well as beating Virginia Tech at Winter Classic, it really felt like Sports was my calling.			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
Besides the cliche friends, events, and bonding, I felt that I really enjoyed the traditions that OYFA has, some of which are hilarious or surprising ;)			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
I am very passionate in video gaming (if that's a thing) and anime.  Although I may seem like I am a couch potato, you'll be surprised as to how much energy I have!  I have various hobbies such as drawing, playing the guitar, and even spinning rifles!  If you're lucky enough, you'll be able to see me perform in the half-times in one of our games at UVA!			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
Telekinesis, why? Because the Force that's why!</div>
