			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
For the past couple of years, ISIP has been severely underrated, and my hope is to reinvigorate the position and get people more excited about embracing Filipino/Filipino-American culture. 			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
The camaraderie   			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
Sneakers (shouts out the VSC), Hip-Hop (shouts out SHHO), and as nerdy as it sounds, learning (shouts out academia). 			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
Superspeed

			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
I ran for this position because I wanted to teach others more about Filipino culture, specifically about the values and lifestyle that define our way of life. I also want to make Filipino culture very accessible for those who aren't familiar with it so that through our events people can walk away knowing a little bit more about our culture. 			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
I enjoy the sense of family and togetherness that OYFA embodies, as well as our determination to make the most of our experiences here at UVA. I've never met a more motivated group of people who aim to be well-rounded in all aspects of the UVA community, and that's reflected in our work ethic and involvements in the broader UVA community.			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
Something that I've always been passionate about is helping others. I find myself to be a happier person when I'm able to serve others and make their lives a little easier and happier, which is a big reason why I enjoy being an EMT in my spare time. There's a unique sense of satisfaction gained from helping members of the Charlottesville-Albermarle community, and it's something I really cherish and enjoy.			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
I'd want the ability to stop time. Technically it also counts as teleporting because I could stop time and move somewhere else, and I'd also never be late to anything and still get a chance to maximize sleep, which I'm sorely lacking in at the moment.
