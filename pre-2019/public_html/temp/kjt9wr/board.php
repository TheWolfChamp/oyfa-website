						<b>1. Why did you decide to run for this board position?</b><br>
When asked why I wanted to run for President, the answer was simple: the passion from all of its current and past members. Having served in other leadership positions in other student groups, this is one of the few made up of people driven by their dedication to the organization. Planning large-scale events such as Barrio comes easy to us as we are willing to sacrifice as much time and energy necessary in order to benefit others. I am honored to serve these people and to continue to be a part of such an amazing organization. 
						<p>
						<b>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</b><br>
OYFA is filled with people to mentor and guide you, to take you on adventures, and to help you to push the boundaries you once thought you could never go beyond. In just three years OYFA has helped me learn about myself and grow not only socially, but also academically through the advice and guidance of upperclassmen. 

						</p>
						
						<p>
						<b>3. What is something you are passionate about?</b><br>
I really enjoy making music, more specifically playing cello. Performing music is such a unique way to express yourself, either through the compositions of the greats such as Shostakovich, Tchaikovsky, and Beethoven, or doing a cover of a pop song with friends. I've learned a lot through music and I hope that it will continue to be a part of me for the rest of my life.						</p>
						
						<p>
						<b>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</b><br>
I would want to have the power to teleport. I love to travel and experience different cultures, plus most of my days consist of running to class and meetings, so being able to teleport would make it much easier to get everything done.						</p>

						<p>
						<b>1. Why did you decide to run for this board position?</b><br>
I ran for the position of vice president because of the job description and what I've seen VPs do in the past. It is the VP's job to not only work with the members of board and council to make OYFA as amazing as possible, but also to oversee council and help the council and board members to bond. It was the bonding aspect of the job that really drew me in and made me want to run for the job. I love bonding with other people and making new friends and so I'm really excited to be able to create bonding opportunities and bond with the members of board and council and the entire organization!						<p>
						<b>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</b><br>
This is totally cliche, but I love the familial aspect of OYFA. From the moment I joined my second year, I felt welcomed and loved and knew that this was an organization that I would be committed to for the rest of my time here at UVA. OYFA is an organization that is made up of people who will make you laugh hysterically or who will have deep life talks late at night with you. It's a place where you can find your best friends but more importantly your family. This is what I enjoy and love most about OYFA.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<b>3. What is something you are passionate about?</b><br>
Food. I am really really passionate about food and eating. I'm also really passionate about making the world a better place and working to end injustice around the world. But mostly food :)						
						<p>
						<b>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</b><br>
Teleportation that way I wouldn't have to walk from my room to the kitchen to get food, I could just teleport there and save time. It would also save me time getting to class because I could just get up, get dressed, and blink my eyes and I would be in class, so I'd never be late.

						<p>
						<b>1. Why did you decide to run for this board position?</b><br>
I decided to run for Treasurer because last year I was one of the Community Chairs and fell in love with OYFA.  I loved planning events that reached out to the UVA and Charlottesville community and as Treasurer I knew I would have a hand in making all the OYFA events happen.  Along with the position, I am fortunate enough to be a family head which allows me to balance my internal OYFA work with the external portion.  						<p>
						<b>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</b><br>
I love how OYFA allows me to network with people that I wouldn't have interacted with otherwise.  Everyone comes together to learn about Filipino culture but people stay because all the people around you become your family.  Whether you come to only one event or all the events, people will remember your name and treat you as if they have known you forever.  It is such a unique experience that most people don't get to experience at a large university such as UVA.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<b>3. What is something you are passionate about?</b><br>
I am passionate about community service and helping people achieve their goals.  This passion is what initially run for Community co-chair after my first year.  I have been involved in Madison House and other volunteering groups on Grounds since my second semester at UVA and have fallen in love with the Charlottesville community.  I love seeing the smiles on people's faces after hard work; I hope everyone has the opportunity to volunteer and serve their community while at UVA and beyond.						
						<p>
						<b>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</b><br>
I would love to transform into a black cat at my command.  Black cats are so sneaky and innocent that I am sure they can escape any situation that they get themselves in, which would be extremely useful for me.

						<p>
						<b>1. Why did you decide to run for this board position?</b><br>
I chose to run for Corresponding Secretary because after having an awesome experience as Membership for a year, I wanted to continue my involvement in OYFA as a Board member! Membership gave me insight into what being a family head was like, so I was inspired to become one myself! I'm also super excited to bring you all an unforgettable Fall Symposium :)  						<p>
						<b>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</b><br>
"What I love most about OYFA is how welcoming everyone is, and how many opportunities it has given me. Although I am not Asian, I was immediately welcomed and integrated into the OYFAmily. I've been able to learn a lot about Filipino culture, but also about other diverse cultures from the variety of members in OYFA. In return, I've been able to share a little bit of my own Hispanic culture too! I also appreciate that OYFA gives opportunities for growing as a leader and as a person in general. I've learned so much about my leadership style/abilities as Membership Chair and will continue this journey as Co-Sec. I've also been encouraged to come out of my comfort zone and eventually choreographed traditional and modern dances for Culturefest and Barrio!
All in all, OYFA has been a place where I have been able to blossom as a leader, challenge my comfort zone, and most importantly, meet many wonderful individuals that make up my OYFAmily <3"
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<b>3. What is something you are passionate about?</b><br>
That's easy! Music! My passion for it basically began when I was in the womb lol.  In elementary school, I pretty much knew every Beatles song that was ever made. I started playing the flute in 4th grade and stuck with it for 9 years. It wasn't until middle school/early high school when I started exploring different genres and learned how to download music lol. My iTunes grows pretty much exponentially. I'm a fan of most genres and can probably recognize the majority of songs you throw at me. Fun fact: my most played song is Claire de Lune with over 3000 plays. If you ever wanna talk music, hit me up! :)						
						<p>
						<b>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</b><br>
I would have the superpower to get rid of this question from all surveys ever again. LOLOLOL JK. 
I would have the power to change the weather to anything I'd like :) Blizzards and beach weather alternating every week. LOL

						<b>1. Why did you decide to run for this board position?</b><br>
I had become invested in OYFA very early in my first year and, while I genuinely enjoyed every second of my experience as a baby and general member, I perceived that more could be done to expand and improve this beloved organization and thus, here I am. As a board member, I would like to make myself available to all those within the organization and make myself open to suggestions and criticisms. In this way, the organization can grow and learn as one.						<p>
						<b>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</b><br>
I enjoy the pure dedication and investment people commit towards this organization. In their passion to do so, OYFA truly generates a feeling of belonging and welcoming to all individuals and fosters friendships and relationships that are sure to reach beyond college and academics.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<b>3. What is something you are passionate about?</b><br>
I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a fun fact or if it's supposed to be related to OYFA but I'm very passionate about Ford Mustangs. While I don't have one myself, I'm kind of weirdly obsessed with Mustangs and if you're ever in a car with me I shout "Mustang!" whenever I see one. My dream car would be a 1970 convertible Mustang Shelby.						
						<p>
						<b>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</b><br>
Hands down I would want the ability to make all red lights green. I'd never be late to anywhere again (or maybe that's just because I'm Filipino and run on Filipino time).
