			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
I ran for Historic because I wanted to give back to the organization that helped me so much throughout my First Year! Being in charge of keeping a viewable record of events and teaching members about Filipino history is the best way for me to give back.

			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
From the very beginning, OYFA has been a family to me - a group of people that I can turn to for everything and anything. OYFA has been my support base and helped me transition onto college.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
Tbh, UVa wasn't my first choice - it was my third lol oops.  When I got accepted into UC San Diego, I actually committed to it and had the full intent of going there, but on the last day to accept admission into UVa, I decided that at the time, staying in state and going to the best school in Virginia was the right decision.  From that point on, I have had no regrets and am extremely happy with my decision!

			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
I'd like Daniel Davis acting as Niles the Butler from "The Nanny" to play as me because Niles is awesome, like me.  Loljk, but if you haven't seen the show, then you should cause it's great and so is Niles.

			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
			I ran for this position because I really wanted to be as involved with OYFA as possible. Being a first year, I felt I could devote the time needed to commit to this position and I am absolutely honored to be able to help embody these precious memories in OYFA.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
			Being a first year, OYFA was the first organization that really personified a sense of family (OYFamily). I felt at home with everyone in OYFA and genuinely enjoyed all of their activities. Up until the future, I hope to keep this familial attachment throughout my next four years at UVA.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
			To be honest, UVA wasn't my first choice (either). I was originally set on NYU and was super excited that I got in. Through the persuasion of my mom and dad (however) I decided to stay in-state and don't regret my decision. My wonderful Multivariable/DiffEq teacher also brought it to my attention that I could always go to NYU for graduate school so I hold my NYU dreams until then.

			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
			Zooey Deschanel. She is so incredibly awkward in New Girl and it basically exemplifies my life exactly. Plus she always ends up in weird scenarios which is perfect considering how I am eternally caught in weird circumstances.
