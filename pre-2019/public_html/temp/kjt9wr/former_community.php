			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
I ran for Community Chair because helping people is something I truly enjoy doing.  I didnt get to do community service at all in high school, so I saw this as an opportunity to make a big impact in people's lives and get people aware of the importance of giving back to the community.

			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
OYFA was definitely a unique group to get involved because I came from a small school where the biggest club had like 15 people.  After getting more involved with OYFA, I fell in love with how familial everyone was towards each other even though I didnt come to many events.  I look forward to getting more involved with the OYFAm more this year!

			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
I wanted to go to UVA because I know it was going to be the best bet for a great education for a smaller price tag.  Also, I thought taking advantage of the in-state tuition would be a better idea than traveling to another state to pay more for a similar education.  UVA was also well-known for many fields of study, so I knew whatever I ended up majoring in, I would be getting a good education.

			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
I feel like Kristen Stewart (Bella from Twilight) would do a good job as me in a movie.  I love the awkward but funny vibe she gives off because it reminds me a lot of me.  I just remember watching Twilight and laughing at her awkward acting and I think a lot of people see me that way, which is great because I love making people laugh!  Sure she does not look like me...like at all...but that's nothing a little make-up couldn't fix! :)

			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
I wanted to run for community chair because I love to volunteer and serve others. I considered this a great way to combine my passion for planning large events and giving back to the community. I was really drawn by the fact that I was able to help out both the local Charlottesville community and give back to the Philipines at the same time.

			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
OYFA has become my home away from home. I first joined it because I wanted to learn more about Filipino culture. However, it has become so much more than that. Through OYFA, I was able to find good friends and good times. We are like one big family! I know that I will always be able to go back to it no matter what happens :)

			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
I wanted to go to UVA because I loved the people and the atmosphere. Not only did it have a good pre-med program, but it also provided a good balance between studying and having a good time. I believe out of all my options, this school was the best fit for me. 			
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
I would like Anne Hathaway to play me in a movie about my life. She can be very outgoing and fun, but she can also be very serious in her movies. I like her playful nature and I feel like she would depict my personality really well!
