			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
I decided to run for PR because I love to design flyers and create promotional videos. After seeing OYFA's flyers generate interest throughout the UVA community last year, I was inspired to help to promote and help establish OYFA's diverse image.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
A huge part as to why I love UVA, is OYFA. There have been countless inside jokes, midnight snacks, and late-night/early-morning (attempts) at group studying that have contributed to an unforgettable year. You can always rely on your friends and family in OYFA for an amazing time.	
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
The atmosphere at UVA is honestly unmatched anywhere else. It's pretty cool how driven, yet chill people are in general. I'm constantly reminded about how awesome it is through the people I meet, and when I'm just walking around grounds. I love the vibe here! 
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
Probably Drew Barrymore. She's got the whole calm, slightly awks and relatable side of me down. Plus, she's played roles where she's hyper, and sarcastic and stuff too. I feel like the combination of these qualities kinda reflect me pretty well!

			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
I ran for PR because I wanted to become more involved in OYFA while helping to play a role in upholding the quality of flyers and posters. When I first joined OYFA, I was really intrigued by the flyers’ unique style and professionalism and I think the materials really help to convey what a special group of people OYFA is.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
OYFA played a huge part in an amazing first year for me. They’ve become some of my closest, funniest, most hardworking and loving friends and I can always count on them to help wake me up before an exam, bring me meds when I’m sick, or even just like my profile picture on Facebook (lol meep). I’m honestly so grateful to be a part of such an amazing community.			
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
One of the best public universities in the U.S. + in-state tuition!
<br>
Honestly though, those are really the main reasons I chose UVA. After a year here, I realized however that I really made the right choice for completely different reasons. I love being in such an academically rigorous environment, not to mention the actual environment of Charlottesville is really beautiful. I love being in a big university where I can meet so many different people and have a really exciting college experience!			
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
Definitely Mindy Kaling. She’s witty, blunt, so funny, and I dream of being her best friend. Her TV roles are pretty much always women with hilariously dysfunctional lives and hopefully she could make it seem like I’m super exciting because I am. Plus we already look really similar so why not.
