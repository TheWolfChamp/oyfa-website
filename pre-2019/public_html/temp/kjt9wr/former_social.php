			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
			I ran for social because I love that this position has the ability to bring people together and maintain the bonds and friendships we've made! I also enjoy the time I spend with OYFA and I want to partake in planning that! Also, I just like to have fun with everyone!
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
			OYFA, like ohana, means family and family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten; but actually I just know that these people will always be there for me and appreciate that.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
I wanted to come to UVA because I knew it was one of the best schools in Virginia. I also knew I wanted to get away from home and have some independence and this was just enough that I was away but close enough to go home if needed. But most importantly, UVA accepted first years into the nursing school for their four year program. When I found out I got accepted into the school of nursing, I knew I was going to attend UVA and I'm so happy to be here!
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
Me because aside from nursing I want to be famous and meet all the cute boys, holla! ;)

			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
I knew by the end of the fall semester last year that I wanted to run for a council position for my third year, I just wasn't sure which one. I loved all of the social events that I attended last year and during the year I thought of some ideas for other events that I thought would be fun. I guess decided to run for social because it gave me the best opportunity to try out these ideas and plan some really awesome events and parties for OYFA.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
I can honestly say that OYFA is my family. Thanks to this organization I have met some of my best friends at UVA and have gotten to know some really amazing people. Not only have I learnt more about the Filipino culture, but I have also learnt more about myself and the people around me. My college experience would not be the same without OYFA and all the OYFAns I have met.

			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
UVA was actually not my first choice. I wanted to leave Virginia, but most of the out-of-state schools I applied to were extremely expensive and I was waitlisted at my top choice, UNC Chapel Hill. So when I got into UVA, my dad told me to give it a try since it was a great school and it was in-state (YAY in-state tuition!). I am so glad that he told me to do that because I absolutely love UVA and doubt I would be as happy anywhere else.

			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
Willow Smith, because I can whip my hair back and forth too. Jkk, I'm not sure. Maybe Shay Mitchell because she is awesome, beautiful, and would probably make my life sound really cool. It also helps that she is an actress in one of my favorite shows...
