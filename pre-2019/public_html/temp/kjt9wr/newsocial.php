			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
						I decided to run for Social because OYFA has become my home away from home, and I wanted to get more involved with it. I loved going to the social events throughout the year, so I thought it would be fun to come up with and plan those events for the upcoming year.<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
						Barrio. It was amazing seeing everything come together after so many weeks of practice, and performing on that stage with the rest of my class was an experience I'll never forget.		<br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
						All the free food that is usually served during events on grounds, meeting new people, and spending time with friends.   <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
						Hermione Granger, because I was obsessed with Harry Potter as a kid and who wouldn't want to have magic?

			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
					In my experience as a historian and council member in general, I have been able to meet almost everyone in OYFA. I have seen them at all the events and I live off of the energy that they bring each time. I really enjoy putting together events for people to enjoy; through the social committee I hope to continue being a part of the fun experiences in OYFA.	<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
					I have to say that there are too many to choose from, but the reason that I became so involved was through all the late night dance practices and study groups. I loved taking a break from school and just learning dances (even though I'm not a great dancer) and then having the support of fellow OYFA members as we took on a long night of homework and studying. Those were the nights that I made friends and decided that I wanted people to have the same great experience and the ease of meeting new people.   <br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
					I'm excited for all the great ideas for events to come to life! I am also excited, once again, to meet the new members that this year will bring. I'm looking forward to making each experience in OYFA as fun and valuable as can be.  <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
					Sabrina from Sabrina the Teenage Witch. I love the idea of magic and I've been jealous of Sabrina since I was young. Each episode showed the pros and cons of using magic to get through life, but overall I wouldn't mind having a little magic.
