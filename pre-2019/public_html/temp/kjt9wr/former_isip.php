			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
I ran for ISIP again because I still want to give back to the organization that gave so much to me my first year. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
OYFA means having someone to study or eat with at any time. It means late nights and lots of talking about everything and nothing. It's a place where I've been able to grow and to give back as a leader. 			
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
I chose UVA because I fell in love with the grounds when I first visited as a sophomore in high school. My dad insisted that out of all of the colleges we visited, it was the right fit for me, and I think he's right. Every time I stroll by the Lawn, I feel like there's no where I'd rather be than here. I guess I just have to thank admissions for agreeing with my dad because I don't know where else I'd rather be than UVA.			
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
I've always said that Ellen Page ought to play me in a movie. I like to think we have the same sense of humor and sarcasm.

			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
I love teaching and learning about my heritage. ISIP is perfect for spreading awareness and knowledge of Philippine culture.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
Essentially, OYFA means support. OYFA is a group of diverse, talented, and passionate people. Through this CIO, I have found some of my closest friends and favorite college memories. OYFA has been late night study groups with friends, picnics on the lawn, a shoulder to lean on during the Good Ol' Song, and never-ending conversations at the Whiskey Jar.

			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
UVA offers wonderful scholarship opportunities and a wonderful ivy league school education for a public school price. 			
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
I would be Penelope from The Brother's Bloom. In the movie she is going out to the world to be a part of an adventure, and eventually creates her own.
