			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
						I thought it would be the perfect position for me because it combined art and OYFA--two things I am passionate about. And because of that, I saw it not as a job but rather a creative outlet that would allow me to give back to the organization that eased my transition to UVA.<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
						Culturefest! It's something all first years should experience.	<br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
						There are so many things to look forward to this upcoming year! Barrio, serving on council, making new friends, spoiling my Little... the list just goes on and on! But the thing I am looking forward to the most would be helping incoming members create unforgettable memories because OYFA definitely helped make my first year at UVA memorable.   <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
						Rory from Gilmore Girls because she's smart, passionate, driven, and classy. Those are qualities that I truly admire.

			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
					I wanted to become more involved in OYFA because OYFA really helped me find a solid group of friends that can tolerate my craziness. PR felt like a good fit for me since I like messing around with Photoshop. 	<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
					Wing Night in Big/Little Week! My two favorite things in one event - hanging out and eating hot wings <3  <br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
					Filipino Food Night because FOOD. <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
					Leslie Knope from Parks & Rec but in reality I'm more of a Tom Haverford
