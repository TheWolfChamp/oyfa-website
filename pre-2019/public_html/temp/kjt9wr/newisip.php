			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
						I ran for ISIP Chair for the following reasons: 1) another chance to give back to this amazing organization, 2) to advocate for our Filipino/Filipino-American heritage and culture, and 3) to promote awareness about current events happening around the world and within our community.<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
						I will never forget my first Barrio!!! That whole day was amazing filled with joyous memories! I had the honor of composing and conducting the Philippine National Anthem for OYFA's 25th anniversary as well as performing traditional Filipino dances. We all worked hard that day and were able to relax afterwards at the "After-Barrio Party!" ;D<br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
						I cannot wait for the arrival of the new OYFAn babies as well as the what they will bring to the table for this upcoming year! In addition, I can't wait to make more memories with my friends! Oh yeah! I ALSO can't wait to close my last year - here at the university - with Barrio Fiesta 2016!!! ~~Yayy~~ <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
						Hmm...that's a toughy. I'd say that it would be awesome if I was Michael the Archangel from the SyFy series "Dominion."
