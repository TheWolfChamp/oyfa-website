			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
Although the OYFA is a group focused on Filipino culture, there is a familial aspect that comes with it. The culture sparked my interest, but the life-long friendships I've made is what keeps me. As Membership, I hope to improve on the Big/Lil and Family System and to make fun events that everyone can enjoy to make OYFA a home for everyone that comes through.			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
Barrio season is definitely my favorite time of the year. The show we put on as an organization takes so much work and preparation that everyone can be proud of. I like dancing and going to practices and just seeing it all come together. Barrio is the best and I can't wait to see what 2015 has in store!			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
If I could just sit around all day doing nothing, I'd probably be drawing or painting. Art's something that I used to do a lot of, but I've just lost the time to do. I'm probably going to try and get back into it this summer.			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
Teleportation is definitely up there! I'm one of those people who has to travel the world before they die, so being able to just pop in and out of Australia or Brazil would be pretty sweet.

			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
I still remember when I was a first year coming to grounds without knowing much about UVA. Luckily, OYFA's membership chairs helped the college experience less daunting, and tons of fun! I ran for Membership Chair because I wanted to recreate my experience for first years, transfers, and even upperclassmen to demonstrate how remarkable the University can be. 			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
Definitely the friendships and connections you make, whether it be through big/little bonding, Barrio, or family events! Throughout my 3 years in OYFA (I can't believe I'm a fourth year now!), I have made many genuine friendships that I will cherish beyond graduation. 			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
I love traveling! (LOL lame answer) 			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
Flight, so I wouldn't have to walk up the 5 sets of stairs near Wilson/New Cabell Hall. 		</div>
