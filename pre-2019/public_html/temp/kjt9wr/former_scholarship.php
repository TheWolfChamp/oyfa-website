			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
			I ran for my council position because like everyone else I wanted to give back to OYFA. OYFA has done nothing but give to me all throughout my first year. It gave me memories, experiences, friends, and even family. So I want to be able to give that back to upcoming first years by having a leadership position within the organization.

			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
			Just recently I hosted two prospective students for a night, and when I was telling them about my experiences and how amazing UVA is, I always referred to OYFA. I said that when you're a student here, you're not just getting an education from a prestigious school. UVA isn't just about a name, it offers so much more than that. It's about the experiences you get while here, and meeting people who will change your life forever. That's what OYFA gave me, and I'll always hold that feeling dear to me.

			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
After looking back at everything that OYFA has done for me for the past 3 years, I found that running for Scholarship Chair was one of the major ways I could give back to the organization. The Excellence Scholarship makes OYFA a truly unique CIO - we financially aid first-year students so that they can enjoy all that UVA has to offer. By raising money for this fund, I am able to help many future generations of OYFAns gain their university experience.

			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
Initially, I joined OYFA because I promised many relatives back home that I would grow closer to my Filipino heritage when I went to college. And ever since the first day I came into OYFA, I have strengthened my cultural ties and have gained an entirely new family in the process. This organization is defined by our Filipino traditions, commitment to our community, ability to have fun, and cohesiveness as a family. I have met the most amazing people through OYFA, and the lifelong memories I have made within this group are truly unparalleled.

			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
UVA was my #1 "realistic" choice of where to come to school. When I first visited UVA during "Days on the Lawn," I fell in love with the atmosphere and beauty of grounds, and all the people here were very friendly and welcoming. With its great balance of academic excellence and extracurricular opportunities, I knew that UVA would be the perfect fit.

			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
Ewan McGregor. Short stature, spiked hair, and mole on the forehead. Seems about right. (Added bonus: ability to wield a lightsaber)
