			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
					I decided to run for this position because I wanted to be able to form close bonds with the incoming First Years and influence them in a positive way. I thought that this position would be a great way to advocate the importance of becoming involved in the UVA community whether it's through extracurriculars, volunteering, or leadership positions. This is also a great way to push the new First Years to excel academically. I also decided to run for this position in order to give back to the organization that gave me many great experiences, memories, and friends my first year. <br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
					One of my favorite OYFA memories was Barrio run-throughs the night before Barrio. It was so great seeing everything that we worked hard on come together. It was also a nice surprise getting to see the Fourth Years unveil their all their dances and also to have alumni surprise us by coming back.		<br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
					I'm looking forward to building relations with the First Years and collaborating with other orgs to create a new event that will hopefully be continued in subsequent years.  <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
					I would be Will Gorski from the Netflix show Sense8 because he is part of cluster that consists of 7 other characters who are all connected emotionally and mentally. They can access each other's knowledge, skills, and languages; it's like there are 7 other sides to you!

			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
					I felt like the Scholarship Endowment Committee had the most room for growth. I wanted to take the opportunity to expand the OYFA network between students, alumni and the UVA community. I also wanted to help OYFANs take full advantage of the resources that we can provide, such as the Mentor/Mentee Program, and to emphasize that OYFA is not just a social organization. I decided that I could use my position in OYFA to help raise the academic standards within the asian community here in UVA.		<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
					Barrio: Isang Mundo!  <br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
					Meeting all the new OYFANs! <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
					Mike Ross from Suits.
