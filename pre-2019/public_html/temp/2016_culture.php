			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
						I ran for Culture because my Filipino heritage is important in my life and how I grew up, so I wanted to share that with others. Additionally, events like Culturefest allow people to create bonds and work with one another in order to make something amazing like Barrio, so I wanted to be able to help plan those events.<br>
			<h4>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</h4>
						As cliche as it is, OYFA is a family and home away from home. There are so many people to meet, events to go to, and things to learn about everyone's cultures, backgrounds, and experiences, all while learning about Filipino culture.<br>
			<h4>3. What did you do/plan to do this summer?</h4>
						Most of my summer schedule is traveling as Miss Virginia Job's Daughter with my Miss Congeniality and Misses from other states. I also get to compete in the Miss International version to represent our Commonwealth, so I'll be headed to Grand Rapids in July for that.<br>
			<h4>4. What is the funniest/favorite memory of your childhood?</h4>
						Despite being OYFA's "Most Poised", as a kid I was super clumsy. All my favorite memories involve me falling, whether it be down a hill, off a bike, up/down stairs, under a sink, off a toilet lid, on ice, on sidewalks, or even running into a glass door.
