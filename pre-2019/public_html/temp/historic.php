			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
I ran for Historic because OYFA taught me that pictures are so important for keeping records; whether it be to learn everyone's names or to remember which events I've attended, pictures have been there every step of the way. I would like to give back to the organization by teaching members about Filipino history as well as bring me closer to my OYFamily and allow me to create and record special memories in the year to come!			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
I enjoy being part of such a big family. Being able to walk around Grounds and seeing at least 5 OYFAns has been one of my favorite things able being part of such a large organization. UVA is not a small school and knowing that I always have someone nearby to talk to, eat with, or study with has really shaped my first year experience. 			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
I LOVE FILIPINO FOOD. I love knowing at least one part of Filipino culture; while I was afraid that being a part of an Asian organization for the first time would be a culture shock, Filipino food has allowed me to connect with my fellow peers that have experienced the wonderful world of Filipino food. 			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
Definitely, teleportation. Life would be so much easier if I could just get from one place to another without walking or driving. If people could teleport, there would probably be more laziness and obesity in the world... but there would also be a lot less pollution!

			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
I ran for Historic because I wanted to give back to the organization that helped me so much throughout my first two years at UVa! Being in charge of keeping a viewable record of events and teaching members about Filipino history is the best way for me to give back. 			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
I enjoy how welcoming and friendly everybody is and how I can learn more about my culture through all of the events that OYFA has!			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
I'm passionate about helping people in any capacity that I can!			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
I would say flight because traveling short distances would be more convenient lol.
