			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
						I love sports, I love OYFA, and both of them together seemed like the best option. I am dedicated to both, so I figured this position would suit me the best. Also, I wanted to help get more people involved to this side of OYFA because it's definitely underrated.<br>
			<h4>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</h4>
						OYFA is a family, a home, a get away from school, and a place where I can be myself. <br>
			<h4>3. What do you feel most grateful about?</h4>
						Where I am today. Not having to worry about getting hungry or having a place to sleep, getting an elite education, the opportunities I can make for myself, and having a support system of friends and family.<br>
			<h4>4. If you could have any super power, what would it be and why?</h4>
						To control time so that I can go back and fix my mistakes but also so that I have more time to sleep.
