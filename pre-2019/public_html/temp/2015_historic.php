			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
OYFA played a big part in making my first year as dope as it was. Because of this, I knew that I wanted to have a larger role in the organization during my second year. I decided to run for Historic chair because it combines my interest in Filipino culture and history with my love for photography. I'm hyped to spread the word about our history as well as document new memories!
			<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
One of my most vivid OYFA memories has to be the Welcome Back Party at Poe's/No.3/Eddy's/whatever it is now. It was my first experience hanging out with OYFA and set the tone for the rest of the year. Basically, it was lit.<br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
I'm probably biased, but I am really excited for Historic's events and activities this upcoming year. Richard and I have much in store. Get your bodies (and minds) ready. <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
Tituss Andromedon from Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (peenooo noiiiiiirrrrr)

			<h4>Tell about yourself</h4>
			WHAT'S UP OYFA? I'm Richard Dizon, a second year Computer Science major from Norfolk, VA! I'm super excited to serve as one of your Historic chairs this year! My fancy camera and I promise to minimize the amount of double chin pictures uploaded of you on Facebook, so feel free to treat yo' self to that extra ice cream cone at the dining hall later. I've definitely made a home for myself here at UVA by making tons friends through OYFA and the other organizations I'm involved in like First/Second Year Council, The Cavalier Daily, Peer Advising Family Network and Catholic Student Ministries, so its never been a dull moment for me here on Grounds. I'd quickly describe myself as a caption god with an insatiable thirst for Cookout milkshakes and a passionate love of semi-useless talents like saying the alphabet backwards, so we're definitely gonna have a interesting time together this year in OYFA.
