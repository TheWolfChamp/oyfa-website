			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
					I ran for Community Chair because service and helping others is something I truly enjoy doing. After seeing everyday hardships and natural disasters affect places like the Philippines firsthand, I found it especially important to devote my life to service. As Community Chair, I'm given the opportunity to help beyond just the UVA community, but to Filipino communities too. Familial responsibility and Community bond are such big things in Filipino culture and this position allows me to help establish those aspects. <br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
					Barrio 2015! Being a First Year, it was great experiencing it for the first time and seeing everybody put so much hard work into something that upperclassmen had told us so much about. Seeing OYFAns, Alumni, and our friends/families all together really showed how important family is! It was also pretty funny seeing how many of the other OYFAns' families MY family had already met or been friends with in the past, including my Big's parents!   <br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
					I'm looking forward to all the new ideas that our Board & Council will come up with this year. Many of us are first time Council members, so I'm curious as to what each of us can bring to the table. I'm also looking forward to experiencing OYFA from a different perspective, as a Council member and a Big. <br> 
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
					Maybe any Hogwarts student from the Harry Potter series; I got a fake acceptance letter from my sister for Christmas when I was like 12 and it'd seem fun to learn all that stuff, so why not? Or maybe one of the Disney Princesses; Merida, Mulan, and Tiana are my favorites, so one of them!
