			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
						I decided to run for Sports Chair because of how much I love playing sports. Since I was little, I always loved trying out new sports, especially those that were team-based. As I grew older, basketball because the social activity for me and my friends. It would be the sport where I could go to when I needed to destress or get away from my troubles. Throughout highschool I always looked forward to gym class, sports nights, and field days. 	<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
						My favorite memory was definitely the End of the Year Picnic with OYFA. It's a time where I finally got to meet most of the members of OYFA and enjoyed a day of food, activities, and socializing. There was watermelon too. That watermelon was delicious, especially on a hot day around finals. That was the day my co-chair and I ref'd the Powderpuff Bowl, fun stuff! <br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
						Meeting the new fresh meat for the next year for one. I'm also looking forward to the giant events planned with OYFA coming up the next two semesters and definitely going to be a lot more involved than I was last year. <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
						Barney Stinson. He's a freaken boss. Nuff Said.
