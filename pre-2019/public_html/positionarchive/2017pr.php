											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  I wanted to help OYFA out on a macro level and I felt like 
											  PR chair was a great position for me to do that. PR works on relations 
											  between other organizations/the general UVA community as well as how 
											  OYFA portrays itself generally which are two things I believe are 
											  undervalued and underinnovated (I know that's not a word but you get the idea). 
											  I'm also interested in marketing and figured this would be a great way to 
											  hone those skills!

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>

										<p>
											All the smaller get-togethers, honestly. I have loved getting to
											know everyone in OYFA on a more personal level and I look forward 
											to meeting more people as a council member next year.

											Being more ambitious. There's a lot of stuff I want to do but sometimes
