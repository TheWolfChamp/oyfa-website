											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  I decided to run for the position of Recording Secretary, 
											  because I want to bring the hype for the 30th anniversary! OYFA 
											  is my home away from home here at UVA, and I want others to feel welcomed in OYFA!

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 My favorite OYFA memory would be Assassins, because there was too much hype. Even though I 
											 died on the second day, I was too invested into the game that I betrayed my friend and I was given the name "Snake."
											 Also, I got closer with my Big during the game. We ran from Clark to Newcomb in order to get my big a double kill. 
											 It was so intense and I loved every minute of it!

												<h3>What is your favorite childhood memory?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											    My favorite childhood memory would be my birthday party when I turned five. For some reason, my Mom decided 
												to go all out throw a big party for me. She invited all of my daycare friends and bought a playground set for my birthday. 
												The best part about the whole thing was that my Mom and Aunt rented Elmo and Cookie Monster costumes. It was by far the 
												best birthday that I had as a child, and I'm grateful that my Mom was so extra about the whole thing.
