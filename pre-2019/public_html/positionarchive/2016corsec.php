											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  I spent the past year on council serving as sports chair and I felt that running for board would give me an opportunity to give back to the organization I call my home. I wanted to work on my organizational skills and improve my communication skills, so the position of Corresponding Secretary was the most appealing to me.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA merch?</h3>

											<h3>What is something you are passionate about?</h3>
										<p>
											    Basketball and League of Legends. Honestly if I were good enough at League I'd drop out of college and join a pro team in a heart beat, but alas I am not. I like league not because it's a fun video game, but because it is a sport (e-sport) that gives other people a chance to be in the spotlight. It allows people who weren't given the natural athletic ability to be in the center of the stage. As for basketball, well ball is life.

											<h3>Describe your perfect day?</h3>
										<p>
											  Wake up a little after 12, go to lunch with a group of friends. Play league for two or three hours, go to the AFC to play basketball, then a steak dinner with friends, and then a couple of games of Settlers of Catan.
