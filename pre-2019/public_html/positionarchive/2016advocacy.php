											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  OYFA is making a HUGE difference in branching out with an advocacy council. I feel that there is a bit of a disconnect between the Asian/Asian Pacific American community and beyond so I want to make a difference in bridging that gap with Advocacy.

											<h3>What does OYFA mean to you?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 Family! Everyone is so warm and inclusive, OYFA is the family away from family.
										</p>
									</section>
									<section>
											<h3>What do you feel most grateful about?</h3>
										<p>
											    Food. So many people in the world don't get to have dinner today yet I'm surrounded by restaurants with food from all over the world. Getting to eat AND getting to eat food from countries I've never been to is the biggest overlooked blessing.
										</p>

											<h3>What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h3>
										<p>
											  Oh man everything! I love the subjects I'm taking and I can't wait to see what OYFA (especially the first-years!) is bringing this year.

											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											   I ran for Advocacy because I wanted to give back to such a great organization that gave me so many wonderful experiences and memories, celebrate Filipino culture and heritage, and bring awareness to issues concerning the Asian/Asian-American community.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  WHEN MY BIG REVEALED HERSELF. I was in my HISA class and my professor would always start class with asking if anyone had any announcements. Usually no one would say anything but that day someone from the back yelled yes and stood up with a huge poster board of my face and screamed "OANH DAO I'M YOUR BIG" and it was happily ever after. :")

											<h3>If you could have any super power, what would it be and why?</h3>
										<p>
											   I wish I could defeat people with one punch like Saitama so I can finally be Oanh Punch Man (woman?). Or control the weather (snow days for all)  
										</p>
									</section>
									<section>
											<h3>What is something you are passionate about?</h3>
										<p>
											   Bees. They are essential to our environment, the food we eat, our wellbeing. If they die out...I don't know exactly what us humans are going to do (maybe artificial robotic pollination? that's sad...) I hope to eventually do research on bees to figure out what's going on with them and how to prevent further death. I would like to become a chicken farmer and beekeeper one day.
