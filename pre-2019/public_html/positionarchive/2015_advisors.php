			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
						I applied to be Student Advisor because I wanted to be a part of the organization that has done so much for me throughout college. I like helping people out and giving them advice on a wide range of topics, so Student Advisor was the right fit for me. <br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
						I can't really choose one favorite memory lmao. I guess my favorite OYFA memory is Barrio season in general. All the hard work that everybody puts into Barrio and seeing it all come together the day of makes it my favorite tbh.	<br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
						I'm looking forward to spending my last year of undergrad with my favorite people and just enjoying everything that UVa has to offer.  <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
						I would be Baymax from Big Hero 6 because he has the right combination of caring-ness and superhero-ness that I like. Also the fact that his armor is super cool doesn't hurt lmao.
