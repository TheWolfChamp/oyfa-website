											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 Not only did I want to increase my participation in a club I found myself having a sense of belonging to, 
											 but I also wanted to possess a role that would allow me to affect and improve the club I throughly enjoy. 
											 Plus, connections are so important to me and Social would really allow me to strengthen the relationships within and outside of OYFA.

											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  I have always loved meeting and getting to know new people. 
											  What better way to do that than through social chair? I get to meet ALL OF YOU! 
											  And make you get to know each other and bring you and everyone else closer 
											  in the OYFA community. My cochair (Jessica) and I aka ~forever socially awkward~ 
											  can't wait for the 2017-2018 year and we hope you come out to the events and enjoy them with us! 
											  Don't forget to RUSH OYFA :)

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>

										<p>
											 Ski Trip 2k17 was definitely my favorite memory. Along with some ~PG~ fun, it made me 
											 realize that OYFA was my people and they are always there for me, whether it is within the UVA 
											 community or outside of UVA.

												<h3>How would you plan your perfect day?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											    My perfect day would involve minimal effort and energy. I wake up after 12PM because mornings 
												are a hassle. I magically wake up with 5 dogs and 2 guinea pigs, ready to be loved 
												(currently animal-less hmu if you have a pet). I eat some ~avocado & egg toast~ because 
												I am bougie af. I hit up my friend and we take a walk with all 5 of my dogs in some pretty 
												scenery, like the ones on Instagram. I snapchat my day because I require constant validation from my peers...
												but I mean who doesn't? After the walk, we go and eat good food at a hole in the wall restaurant 
												(after taking the dogs back). Then I go to the gym to get swole (mostly sitting around on my phone watching 
												Netflix). After getting totally ripped, I get all cute (taking copious amount of time to put on makeup) 
												and go out to a fancy dinner and a ~PG~ party afterwards. I end the day with more snacks because I am probably 
												hungry again at that point and go to bed in my memory foam mattress.

										</header>
										<p>
												Alright....y'all food is my THING this is the one question that I am ECSTATIC to answer. Not saying that 
												the other questions weren't great, but food has a special place in my heart. But, after being vegetarian 
												for 6 years, I feel like this deserves the spotlight: tofu. Y'ALL ARE SLEEPING ON TOFU. IT CAN TAKE ANY 
												FORM (silken, soft, firm, extra firm if u kno what I mean ;) ). IT LITERALLY ABSORBS ALL THE FLAVORS SO. 
												WELL. ITS PROTEIN CONTENT? SEXY AF. TOFU IN GENERAL? SEXY AF. I am very passionate about food (thnx freshman 
												15) but if you ever want someone to get tofu (or any food) w/ hmu I'm always hungry.

											<h3>What is something you are passionate about?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Animals are my life. I cry everyday that I don't have a dog (aka all 19 years of my life). I watch animal 
											documentaries for fun, and volunteer occasionally at the animal shelter. My instagram feed is only bunnies, 
											guinea pigs, cats, and dogs (and 1 pig, 1 otter, and 1 fox). I've always had a soft spot for animals, and 
											sometimes (most times) I prefer them to people (says the social chair but I mean.....). I think everyone 
											should appreciate the animals around them, regardless if they're domesticated or wild. Especially in a time 
											where extinction rates are ever-increasing, we should always be cognizant of our impact on the environments 
											around us and how it affects the local fauna. Save the animals pls. Love them too.
