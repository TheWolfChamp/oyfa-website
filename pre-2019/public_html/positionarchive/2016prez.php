											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>

										<p>
											  In addition to giving back to the organization that provided me with a family away from home, serving as President allows me a unique opportunity to make an impact on the community at UVA.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 The week of OYFAssassins my little and I were attached at the hip; he basically lived at my apartment for the entire week. Although we didn't win, we bonded and it made for funny stories later.

											<h3>What did you eat today?</h3>
										<p>
											    I had garlic bread, which I burnt in the toaster oven (how? idk), and pasta which I made too watery. As is evident, these past three years at UVA I have nearly perfected my kitchen skills.

											<h3>Describe your perfect day?</h3>

											  A day with no work, plenty of food, some Netflix, and my closest friends.
