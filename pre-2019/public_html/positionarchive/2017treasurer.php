											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  Ooooh, this is a pretty hard one. I can't say for sure what it was that motivated me to run for Treasurer.
											  Sure, I had experience serving OYFA through my year as Culture Chair, and sure, I had plenty of ideas on how 
											  I wanted my fourth year to go in relationship to the organization, but those were very superficial reasons to run. 
											  I think what really pushed me to the edge was the regret I'd have felt if I let the opportunity go knowing that 
											  I would be a great Treasurer. I believed greatly in myself and my own abilities. So when I realized that there's no 
											  point in passing up the opportunity, I ran for the position.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 Oddly enough, my favorite OYFA memory would be the time after I lost several OYFA elections. Although it came with a lot of 
											 heartache and feelings of rejection, the outpouring of support I received was incomparable. To me, it was the epitome of 
											 what OYFA's all about. You go into the organization thinking it's just going to be another club to get involved in, but 
											 when the going gets tough, the people you meet in OYFA do become your second family and will go out of their way to 
											 show you that you are loved and appreciated. (So like seriously, a shout out to those peeps. Love you guys.)

												<h3>What is one food you would want other people to try? Why?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											    Durian! It's so misjudged because of the smell, but it's honestly one of 
												my favorite fruits to eat. It tastes like custard, without all the processed sugar.

												<h3>What is something you are passionate about?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											    Farming. Most people (and I find myself doing the same) joke around the idea of it, but I think it's really interesting. 
												Knowing where your food comes from and knowing what goes into it makes you more mindful of what you put into your body. 
												The vegetable on your plate isn't so much a vegetable as it is the result of your hard work, time, and care. 
												I also make a point of saving food scraps to place into a compost pile, which then turns into nutrient-rich soil I can use for saplings.
