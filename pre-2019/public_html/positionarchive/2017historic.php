											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Still has to be my first night before Barrio. I think it was the second to last run-through. First year modern was up. Just when we were halfway through our everyone's dance, the sound cut off! (classic o-hill forum)
											That didn't stop us though. Everyone and their mother were singing the lyrics, "House Party! Party!" and we danced through the night. Or at least for the next 30 seconds. Good days.

												<h3>How would you plan your perfect day?</h3>

										<p>
											  I would want to hang out with my best friends, by the beach, eating lots of food and FUNNEL CAKE (fun fact: I love funnel cake) while in my Eno taking a nap or reading a book.

											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											   I ran for this position because I felt like I saw changes that needed to occur in the organization, and those certain changes weren't truly being addressed in those very moments. So, I decided to run to make a greater conversation with people and to address certain issues in the organization. I think OYFA has been able to bring amazing people together, and I'm very excited to see that this year brings!

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											My favorite OYFA memory so far would be the Historic and Intercourse Session that happened in Spring of 2017. It was the first moment where I saw OYFA really come together and have vulnerable and open conversation. I'm very thankful to have attended that event, and I hope to have more events like that!

											<h3>What is your favorite childhood memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											   My favorite childhood memory would be when my dad surprised me and my brother with a German Shepherd puppy. My dad was always away on business trips, so I remember that day when he came home and surprised me and my brother. I also remember not knowing that the puppy was a female, so we named it Bingo (such a terrible name). It's just a good memory that sticks out to me.

											<h3>If you were talking to a large group of people, what is one piece of professional or personal advice that you would want to share?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  Don't be afraid to speak up and voice your opinions! I think I realized that during my first year. I definitely didn't voice my opinions and lost a lot of opportunities. Although it can be daunting, it's important to have a voice in a group of people because your viewpoint always matters.

											<h3>What is one goal you are working towards now?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  I am definitely working towards more self-awareness and self-love. First year really made me realize the importance of those two. 
										</p>

											<h3>What is something you are passionate about?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  I would say one thing I'm passionate about would be photography. It's a moment of capturing an immense amount of feelings and meanings, and there's always something to elaborate on and see in a photo.
