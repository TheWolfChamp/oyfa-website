											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  I really love doing community service and have ever since I was young so I though 
											  it would be great to experience putting together community service events! On top of 
											  that, I wanted to become more involved in OYFA.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>

										<p>
											 It may be clich√© but both the day before Barrio and Barrio day.

												<h3>What is your favorite childhood memory?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											    This is more of a recurrent memory, but every summer my family would go to Ocean City 
												with our cousins' family and just go to the beach and build sand castles or go to the 
												boardwalk to get funnel cakes and play on boat playgrounds that were in the sand.

												<h3>How would you plan your perfect day?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											  The perfect day is pretty flexible for me. A day at the beach, amusement park, or just 
											  a day filled with fun back to back activities would make me the happiest.

											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I ran for this position because of my love for community service. Participating in service events is not only helpful with 
											leadership skills, but it also brings people together to make a difference. It's my vision to make Community as a committee grow and make a 
											bigger impact within the greater Charlottesville community.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Being a Sakuting choreographer for Barrio 2k16! This position not only helped me try something new (since I never saw myself doing choreography 
											lol) but it also helped me in forming bonds with other OYFA members. It was both an experience in leadership and friendship.

												<h3>How would you plan your perfect day?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											    Traveling to at least three tourist areas would be great. For example, when I went to Hong Kong, I visited Lantau Island which was home to the 
												Big Buddha statue and I tried a bunch of delicious vegetarian meals prepped by the locals. Afterwards, I went to Victoria Peak and saw the 
												whole landscape of the island on top of the mountain. Finally, I ended the day with late night shopping on Temple Street. All of these events 
												happened in 24 hours! If I could do this again, I totally would!

												<h3> If you were talking to a large group of people, what is one piece of professional or personal advice that you

											</header>
										<p>
											   Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone to try something new. You might discover something you really like or are good at, 
											   but you won't know if you don't try right?

												<h3>What is one food you would want other people to try? Why</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
												Balut. Yeah, I know some people are weirded out by it, but I swear it tastes like a boiled egg.

											Kingdom Hearts. I am obsessed with this game franchise.
