											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  I ran for this position because OYFA has been such a big part of my college career and I could 
											  not think of a better way to finish out my time at UVa. As Vice President, I hope to use my 
											  experiences and knowledge to help council have the best experience possible, helping them to grow, 
											  network, and make the most of their year.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 My favorite OYFA memory is as of right now was my first council meeting as Vice President. I was so 
											 happy seeing my council together, and getting to talk as a group for the first time gave me a lot of 
											 hope for the future.

												<h3>How would you plan your perfect day?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											   My perfect day would be a spontaneous day in a cool urban city! Alone 
											   or with a friend. But also, we're rich and can afford the nice food and 
											   transportation and stuff.

												<h3>If you were talking to a large group of people, what is one piece of professional or personal advice that you would want to share?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											    I like to find some inanimate object to stare at, and look at that for the majority of the time, making sure to make actual eye contact 
												with random people in the audience, but always coming back to the inanimate object.
