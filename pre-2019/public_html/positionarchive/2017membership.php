											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I knew I wanted to be membership early in my first year. I honestly really doubted I could 
											do it at first but I eventually realized it'd be perfect for me because I love bringing people 
											together! I just want people to feel at home in OYFA :')

											<h3>What is one food you would want other people to try? Why?</h3>

										<p>
											 Ddukbokki, a spicy rice cake dish and a Korean favorite, so that people can try Korean food other than Korean BBQ :)

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 Music. I know it sounds simplistic and typical but I've realized I'm a simple person who enjoys the smaller things. 
											 The last few concerts I've been to have been pretty small/general admission so I've been able to get front(ish) row 
											 most of the time. I once bought tickets to a concert on the day of without knowing the band and it's still one of my 
											 favorite memories. Also, if I ever saw Tori Kelly live in concert I would just melt and die on the spot.

											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											   I decided to run for Membership because I thought it was the perfect position 
											   for me to be able to give back to an organization that treated me so well during 
											   the first semester of college. I quickly became friends with many of the members, 
											   and I saw myself reaching out to these people and having a bigger impact on them 
											   during my term as membership chair.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  My favorite OYFA memory has to be homecoming weekend when I met so many members and 
											  alumni of the organization. Throughout the day, there was never a time when I did 
											  not feel like part of a family. That weekend was when I knew I wanted to dedicate 
											  my time into OYFA.

												<h3>How would you plan your perfect day?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											   I would first wake up around 6 am to go straight to the beach and surf for a few hours at Croatan (#757).
											   Then, I would get four cheeseburgers and two medium fries for lunch (#bulk). Afterwards, I would 
											   take a power hour nap to refresh myself, and later I would use teleportation to get to a mountain and hike 
											   it, reaching the top right at sunset. Then I would end my day staring at the stars until I fell asleep and 
											   get eaten by bears. What.

												<h3>If you were talking to a large group of people, what is one piece of professional or personal advice that 
												you would want to share?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											    One piece of advice I would give is to ALWAYS be yourself and NEVER let anyone change that. I have said this 
												to people in yearbooks, deep talks and rallies. Especially going into your first year, I 
												think this advice is great for college students.

												<h3>What is one goal you are working towards now?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											    About a year ago, I got into lifting. By Christmas, I plan on gaining 15 more pounds of pure muscle and 
												decreasing the amount of junk food and soda I intake. This sounds really superficial, but I'm trying!
