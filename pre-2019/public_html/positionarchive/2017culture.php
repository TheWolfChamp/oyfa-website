											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>

										<p>
											  What really got me more involved in OYFA was Culturefest. In my opinion, 
											  it was a great way for the older members to make the newer ones feel welcome 
											  and a part of a something at UVA, as well as bond with their current class. 
											  I was drawn to the idea of being able to provide that same experience for next 
											  year's babies. I'm also excited to be an active part of Barrio history and make 
											  my mark for the 30th anniversary alongside my wonderful co-chair, Sophia! :)

												<h3>How would you plan your perfect day?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											    First of all, the weather HAS to be sunny and mid-70s (I loooove the sun, it 
												always makes me feel like I can do anything with my day). Then I'd hit up some 
												of my closest friends and see if they'd want to do something whether it be at 
												the beach (lol 757 rep) or just something to get us out of the house. Car rides 
												are always the best part in my opinion because we'd jam to some of our favorite 
												songs and just enjoy the journey to whatever destination we're headed to. The 
												day would be filled with laughs, picture taking, and wholesome vibes. :)

											</header>
										<p>
											   Honestly, the hardest thing I went through this past year was heartache, but I've 
											   learned that it's not worth wasting tears over something you can't change. I was 
											   broken for months and couldn't really enjoy things to the fullest extent no matter 
											   how hard I tried to fake it, because I was too busy being sad on the inside. What 
											   really helped me was surrounding myself with great company and laughing away all 
											   the insecurities that would eat away at me. I realized that people would actually 
											   want to hang out with me and enjoyed my presence. Rather than be too caught up in 
											   the past or future, take a second to recognize what you have in the moment and never 
											   take that for granted! We're still young and have yet to experience what the rest 
											   of the world has to offer us!
