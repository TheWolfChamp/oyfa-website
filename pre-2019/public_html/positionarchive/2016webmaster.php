											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 Like most members, OYFA has become an important part of my college experience. I wanted to become an officer to help be a bigger part of this organization, and webmaster seemed like the best fit for me. As a CS major, I think learning html and web development is a useful way to apply my involvement in OYFA to my academic career and vice versa.

											<h3>What are you looking forward to most this upcoming year?</h3>
										<p>
											    Meeting new faces, reuniting with old ones, making memories, working on council, long nights having fun, long nights talking, long nights studying/coding, being disappointed with another mediocre Redskins season, you get the point

											<h3>What is something you are passionate about?</h3>
										<p>
											  Something not many people know is that I really enjoy playing Pump It Up which is DDR with diagonal arrows. I haven't found any arcades at UVA so I'm probably gonna buy a pad so I can play at home
