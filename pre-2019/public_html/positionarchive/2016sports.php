											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  I love sports, I love OYFA, and both of them together seemed like the best option. I am dedicated to both, so I figured this position would suit me the best. Also, I wanted to help get more people involved to this side of OYFA because it's definitely underrated.

											<h3>What does OYFA mean to you?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 OYFA is a family, a home, a get away from school, and a place where I can be myself.

											<h3>If you could have any super power, what would it be and why?</h3>
										<p>
											    To control time so that I can go back and fix my mistakes but also so that I have more time to sleep. 
										</p>
									</section>
									<section>
											<h3>What do you feel most grateful about?</h3>
										<p>
											  Where I am today. Not having to worry about getting hungry or having a place to sleep, getting an elite education, the opportunities I can make for myself, and having a support system of friends and family.
