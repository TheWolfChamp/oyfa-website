									is our yearly Filipino cultural show which showcases a skit, cultural dances, and modern dances. We know what you are thinking, 
									"What's the big deal about Barrio?". It is only one of the best cultural shows around the campus, showcasing ~100 performers. It is
									also the culmination of months of skit and dance practice and bonding with your best friends. You don't have to be Filipino 
									to participate! Many (actually probably most) of our choreographers, dancers, and actors/actresses aren't Filipino at all! Don't regret
									not doing or seeing Barrio; it is the single most important event in our organization. You don't have to know how to dance; many of us don't! 
									Performing in Barrio will be something that you'll remember even after you leave college. Just hear the cheer from the front row from UVa alumni that come every year.
