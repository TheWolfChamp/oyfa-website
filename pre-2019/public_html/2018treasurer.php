											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  Coming in as a transfer student, it isn't always easy to find a friend group to 
											  jump into because most of them are already established. OYFA gave me a community
											  where I found a bunch of friends without having to worry about being left out of group activities.
											  Because of this I want to give back to OYFA by being the best treasurer I can be.
