									<h3>About Barrio 2018: Guinta - Recollections</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									On April 7th, 2018, The Organization of Young Filipino Americans hosted the 30th annual Barrio Fiesta at the MLK Performing Arts Center, with the theme of “Pagkatuklas – Discovery.” 

									Discovering the fun-filled skit of Barrio, the members learn more about what it takes to put on the biggest show of the year. Quickly seeing how it is not easy to come together, the members find out that to organize the show, they would need some Barrio Magic. 
									Through hardship, hard work, and each other, they discover their culture and also themselves!
									
								</p>
								<p>
									Various traditional dances included the annual Igorot, Sakuting, Polkabal, and more. To make Barrio even more special, each class also choreographed their own modern dances! Audience members, friends, and performers also gathered together in a Filipino potluck reception at the end of the show, where people could learn traditional dances such as Sakpaya (the bird dance) and Tinikling (bamboo stick dance).

									<h3><a href="#">Igorot</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Igorot is one of the only traditional dance we perform that is not fully rooted in Filipino culture. Based on the culture on the Tribe 'Igorot', we have adapted some of their own traditional dances into one of our own. Most similar to Idaw, our Igorot Dance is symbolic of manhood and masculinity.

									<h3><a href="#">Chotis</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The Chotis was originally from the Bohemian region of the Czech Republic, but it spread across all of Continental Europe, with each country adding their own distinct twist to the Polka Dance. It was popular in Madrid, Spain and therefore imported to the Philippines via the Spaniards during the Colonial Era. This Filipinized version of the Chotis features young ladies as they flirtatiously dance with fans.

									<h3><a href="#">Singkil</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Although the Singkil is secular in nature, it is associated with the Filipino Muslim community because it originated from the Maranao, a Muslim tribe located in the southern island of Mindanao. The dance is based on their re-telling of an Indian epic. Originally only royal women danced the Singkil and it served to show them off to potential suitors. Now it is popular to perform this dance during festivals.

									<h3><a href="#">Jota Paragua</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The Jota is a Spanish genre of music and dance with several regional variations. The Jota Paragua for example has origins in Palawan. This dance combines Spanish footwork with Filipino dress. Especially the distinctly Filipino bamboo castanets worn by the male dancers. The Jota became very popular during the Colonial Era when Filipinos would imitate the Spanish dance during their own indigenous festivals.
