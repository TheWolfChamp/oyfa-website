											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 I decided to run for D7 so I can meet new people from different schools, 
											 learn about their organizations, and connect them with OYFANs. The
											 goal is to build a network of Filipino communities, gain new perspectives,
											 and learn from each other.

											   It'd be just a day full of dogs, friends,
											   and food. Like a day-long picnic in a dog
											   park where all the dogs were mine and the 
											   food was catered by restaurants from around the world.

												<h3>Is water wet?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
										Wetness is a state of being that is caused by water.
										For example, a blanket can be wet or hair can be wet.
										This implies that these objects have several states, 
										such as wet and dry. However, water itself cannot be 
										wet because it only changes the states of other objects,
										but does not have the state itself. Therefore, water is not wet.

											   OYFA did so much for me in terms of making me feel welcomed 
											   to the university as a first year and I wanted to be involved
											   in continuing that atmosphere for future students. While being 
											   Social Chair last year was hard work (and lit), I want to continue 
											   being social but now bring my passion and enthusiasm beyond the UVA
											   community as a D7 representative.
