												<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>

										It's so cliche but Barrio!! Literally everything about it!!! I also tried Lechon and Balut for the first time last Barrio so it holds a special place in my half filipino heart <3

												<h3>If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</h3>

												TRANSPORTATION! It's literally the most logical superpower, fight me! You could just straight up disappear, you could be soaking up the sun, and you could even fly if you really wanna....you just gotta find a way to like...ride a bird?

											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I wanted to be a part of the change in the organization that we are trying to pursue. 
											The Community Committee is a very flexible committee with a lot of potential. I believe
											that the organization can be a part of something bigger by building strong relationships 
											with other local and national Filipino and Asian organizations.

											<h3>If you were given the AUX, which song would you play?</h3>

										<p>
										I mostly listen to OPM (Original Pinoy Music). I would definitely play I Need You More Today by Caleb Santos. Check it ooout. Also, HMU if you wanna learn more of OPM!

												<h3>What is your favorite anime?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											   Aside from Naruto (of course) I really enjoy Tokyo Ghoul. It's a bit gore, but it adds up to its amazing plot and fighting scenes. Watch it with meee.

												<h3> What is one goal you want to accomplish by the end of the year?</h3>

											   I just started working out last January and have gained 15 pounds. Planning out to gain 15 more!

												<h3>How would you plan your perfect day?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
												A perfect day for me would be a lazy day. Just sitting outside early 
												in the morning or late in the afternoon enjoying the breeze and reading a good book or having wholesome conversations with people.

												<h3>Favorite class at UVA and why?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											I would highly recommend GDS/RELG 3820: Global Ethics and Climate Change. It's one of the few non-science courses I was able to take as a transfer student. It really opens your mind to the non-environmental aspects of climate change. I feel bad now whenever I pump gas into my car.

										<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
										I would definitely choose Barrio! It was just so nice seeing everyone together on stage performing what they've been working hard on for two months. All those practices and filming for the skit was so worth it, and I also co-choreographed a traditional dance which turned out really well!
