											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I knew it would be a challenge but definitely a fun challenge. Other than just planning the events, I want to use my platform to strengthen bonds within OYFA. Sometimes we get so comfortable with the friends around us but when you go somewhere like ski trip or to an oyfa party, you get to have a great time with people you’ve met for the first time.

												<h3>How would you plan your perfect day?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											    I sleep in til 10am. I wake up and cook the fluffiest chocolate chip pancakes. Then I would plan an adventure somewhere. While I’m out, I would do a little shopping too. Eventually, I would get hungry so I would find the nearest McDonald’s. At McDonald’s, I order a crispy chicken sandwich with large fries and a large strawberry banana smoothie. I then go back home to take my afternoon nap which will probably be around 3 hours. After my nap, I eat more food and then I get ready to go out.

												<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											   Ski Trip!! Before ski trip, I only knew the people in my class and maybe a couple upperclassmen well, but during the trip I was able to meet so many more people. I honestly had so much fun. It was truly a great bonding experience in OYFA. If you’re debating whether to go or not, you should definitely go!!!

												<h3>If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
												I would be able to fly. It would make traveling a lot easier and if I’m ever late to class, I can just fly there.

												<h3>If you were stuck in an Island and could only eat one food the entire time, what would you choose?
												</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											Rice, because I can’t live without it but I would probably die because it’s not nutritious so I’m changing my answer to avocado.
