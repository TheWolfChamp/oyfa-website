											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 I ran for treasurer mainly because I love OYFA and I wanted to continue playing a role in its journey. My experience on Board this past year was great, so I knew it was something I wanted to keep on doing.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Probably Barrio this year was my favorite because being in Singkil was the coolest feeling and I tried harder for the modern dances so it was more fun and hype. I was screaming internally the whole time but in a good way.

											<h3>Would you like to be famous?  For what reason?</h3>
