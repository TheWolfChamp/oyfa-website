											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  Throughout my first year, I felt like OYFA was a place where I really belonged. I was able to connect with a large network of
											  people that would soon become my family. From casual hangouts to the OYFA Winter Ski trip, I found myself looking forward to spending my time
											  with my friends. I ran for the Webmaster position because I wanted to project the same feeling of compatibility within the organization, while at
											  the same time, sharpening my coding skills. As Webmaster, I hope to offer an approachable, recognizable, and impressionable aspect to council through
											  my work and personality.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 Looking back, my favorite OYFA memory would have to be whenever I walked to classes on Grounds because I would always see friends from OYFA.
											 Being part of such a large organization like OYFA really helped me integrate into the UVA community because I was able to know so many people.
											 In turn, the new friendships that I made helped me build connections in other communities, like Student Hip Hop Organization (SHHO) and Student Council.

												<h3>How would you plan your perfect day?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											   My perfect day would start off waking up early in the morning to check my phone and check out the news and watch videos. Then, I would get ready and work on some school or personal work.
											   By noon, I would be cooking an assortment of vegan comfort foods, like pulled "pork" BBQ, "ham"burgers, and lots and lots of salads. After letting the food digest, I would hit the gym for
											   about an hour or go on a hike for two hours with friends. Then, I would come back home, eat some Cambodian food and talk with my family. To end the day, I would walk around the lake with my
											   family and then finish up the night by watching a movie.

												<h3>If you were talking to a large group of people, what is one piece of professional or personal advice that you would want to share?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											    Before, I would be so fixated on my shortcomings and compare myself to others. However, it wasn't until I classmate said to me, "Why do you worry about them? You are you, and they are [themselves]."
												After thinking about what she said for a while, I realized that people have different strengths and different weaknesses. We are all made differently. If we were meant to be the same, the world
												would be a very disinteresting place.

												<h3>What is one goal you are working towards now?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											   After going through a lot of changes during my first year, I am working on becoming happier with my physical, academic, and social aspects of my life.
											   I know that with the right mindset, everything will fall into place.

												<h3>I hand you the AUX cord. What song are you playing?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											   Anything on my "R is for Relaxed" or "R is for Relaxed Pt. 2" playlists on Spotify! I made the playlist with the Culture chair, Roseanna, and it is perfect for you if you like a blend of Hip Hop and RnB.

												<h3>What is one food you would want other people to try? Why?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											    Banh Xeo. It is a meat crepe from both Cambodia and Vietnam that is served with lots of fresh vegetables and fish sauce! It's light, tangy, and savory. So delicious, I highly recommend.
