											 Being a Student Advisor let's me connect with what I think is the most important part of OYFA, 
											 you, the general members! I love meeting new people and I can't wait to get to know all of you! 
											 Feel free to reach out to me or Dani if you ever need any *~advising~*!

												<h3>What is your favorite childhood memory?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											  One time over the summer, I had a particularly boring orchestra rehearsal that ended quite 
											  earlier than we expected. None of us had any plans for the rest of the day so we spontaneously 
											  decided to drive over to Busch Gardens, an awesome theme park an hour away from us.

											Nothing about the park was particularly novel to us, all three of us had been to this park 
											multiple times before but there's just something magical about making spontaneous plans that 
											end up becoming great days. Normally we would've just went home and did whatever we felt like 
											but it ended up being one of my favorite memories from early high school.

											Not much has changed since then, since I still love making spontaneous plans (sorry to my 
											friends who are long-term planners, you know you are). You never know what can happen! The 
											worst that can happen is that you have an uneventful day, but it's always worth the effort 
											because you would've ended up doing nothing important anyways!

												<h3>If you were talking to a large group of people, what is one piece of professional or personal advice that you would want to share?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											   Learn how to talk about yourself! First impressions are pretty lasting and especially 
											   when you're meeting people for the first time, inevitably the question will pop up, 
											   "What do you do?". It's up to you to figure out how to answer that question but no 
											   one knows the best answer to that than you! Figure out what drives you, what you're 
											   passionate about, no one else can make that decision for you!

											Also as a slight aside, if you're planning on going to a career fair soon, let me know 
											and I'll help you craft a bomb pitch for yourself!

												<h3>What is one goal you are working towards now?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											  Right now I'm trying to catch up on journaling. I regularly kept a journal for two and 
											  a half years but life just started getting crazier and crazier and suddenly I lost track 
											  of keeping up with it, which may or may not be a good thing, because it's a sign that I'm 
											  living a busy, fulfilling life! People do always say that college goes by in a flash, so for 
											  me going into my fourth year, I want to make sure that I keep track of all of these memories somehow. 
											  I hope that one day I'll be able to flip back through the pages of my journals and be reminded of all 
											  the memorable times I've had throughout my college years.

												<h3>What is one food you would like other people to try? Why?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											  Last Spring Break I went to NYC and one of my best friends recommended a restaurant to me and told me to 
											  get the blueberry pancakes. Believe me when I say that not only were these the best pancakes I've ever had, 
											  they just might have been the best food I've ever had in my ENTIRE LIFE.

											Granted, the extent of my pancake knowledge is that stuff they serve at the dining hall and IHOP, but for me to say that they were the best thing 
											I've ever eaten sets the bar pretty high! I've spent the past summer in Seattle on a brunch quest to find better pancakes than the ones I had that 
											morning and honestly, nothing has ever come close to those pancakes.

											If you're ever in New York, I HIGHLY recommend that you go to Clinton St. Baking Company and have their blueberry pancakes. Tell me if they changed 
											your life like they changed mine!

											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 While I was D7 rep I fell in love with being on OYFA Council and watching the people 
											 around me grow. I knew that I wanted to be an instrumental in the growth of future 
											 Council members, but in a more laissez-faire approach than someone on Board. I'm also 
											 really passionate about helping people, so I wanted to be a resource for anyone in OYFA. 
											 Applying to be Student Advisor seemed like the best way for me to give back to the org by 
											 doing something that I love during my last year at UVA.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 It was Food Fight during Family Week of my second year. That whole night everyone was doing 
											 absolutely outrageous and slightly disgusting food challenges for the sake of the family. 
											 During the part where we had to eat donuts off of a line without our hands, Brian and I 
											 double teamed the last donut. I realized that some of us would do anything to win and my 
											 family could swallow many things whole (SHOUT OUT TO KALINGA!). It was a great time and 
											 even though it was a family competition, we all supported each other and showed that 
											 despite the fact that we were broken up into smaller families, we were still one big family.

												<h3>If you were talking to a large group of people, what is one piece of professional or personal advice that you would want to share?</h3>

											   No matter what direction life takes you, live life to the fullest. This world has so much to offer, so always challenge yourself. It doesn't 
											   matter if you want to set a goal as small as making a new friend, doing your laundry, or working  out a certain number of times a week. There 
											   will always be room for improvement in life. Don't get me wrong, it is perfectly fine to be satisfied with life, but without challenges life 
											   becomes stagnant. Is living idly in a peripatetic world even living?

												<h3>What is one goal you are working towards now?</h3>

											  Creating deeper relationships with my friends and putting myself out there more. College is the time to network and create everlasting memories, 
											  and I really want to spend my last year with no regrets and make sure everyone in my life knows how much I appreciate them. This past year I 
											  spent a lot of superficial time with people so my goal is to be present in all of my interactions and be completely transparent with the people in my life.

												<h3>What is something you are passionate about?</h3>

										<p>
											  I am passionate about people. For years now I've been hooked on the notion of dedicating my life to helping people. Some of you reading this may have 
											  witnessed my rants of me being sad because I'm not helping the world fast enough. My goal is to be able to touch the lives of others so that 
											  they can not only improve their life, but also be able to affect someone as I had affected them. There's nothing worse than wasted potential, 
											  so I wish to help others see their potential and guide them into using it to the fullest.
