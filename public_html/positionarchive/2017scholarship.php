											 I've learned a lot getting to where I am now and I'd really like to share what I can with others, give good advice, and make sure Oyfans are getting the best out of their time at UVA.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 I'll put two. During my first year Barrio, we were scrambling to find a practice location for the last practice. We all ended up in the bandroom (thanks to Marc Guzman) and we watched UVA basketball play. There was such an incredible spirit that night which carried over to our practices. The other favorite memory was my second year as culture. I handled the last Culturefest practice and it felt good knowing I was supporting the then-babies.

											  Since it's my last year at UVA (cry), I knew I wanted to

											  scholarship position because it's a great opportunity to
											  share my academic and professional experiences and provide 
											  important developmental resources to our lovely OYFAmilia.

												<h3>If you were talking to a large group of people, what is

												want to share?
												</h3>

										<p>
											    Don't make professional or personal choices solely based on others' 
												expectations of you. Just do you â€” you'll be more motivated to 
												achieve your standard of success, and you'll be much happier in 
												the long run.
