											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  When deciding to run for co-sec I kept thinking about what made me love OYFA so much when I first joined. 
											  I wanted to give back to this organization because it has been such an integral part of my life at UVA. 
											  I feel as though I wanted to take on a role that would facilitate the same environment that made members fall in love with OYFA. 
											  I'm currently trying to keep people's faith alive and help them remember why they love coming to OYFA events.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 My favorite OYFA memory was last year's Winter Classic. 
											 It felt so good to see weeks of hard work pay off to win the Co-Rec division championship. 
											 I mean yeah, we won, but what I'll remember most is the journey there, the laughs we had during the games, the hardships we overcame that day, and the support that everyone gave me and my co-chair throughout the whole process. 
											 All in all, I was able to do what I love with people that I love being around. Nothing better than that :)
