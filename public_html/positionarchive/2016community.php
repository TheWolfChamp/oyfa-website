											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I wanted to be one of the Community chairs for OYFA because I've always seen the value in servant leadership. Community is definitely the committee I've gravitated to most readily because of how I feel for service. Although it's a smaller committee, I see the potential to help it grow and to make it a more prominent facet of our organization.

											<h3>Favorite OYFA merch?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 My favorite piece of OYFA merch is definitely the frocket. It's such a versatile piece. I can wear it to the gym or to class if I'm feeling lazy, but I can also style it up and pair it with my favorite denim shirt! You really can't go wrong with the frocket.

											<h3>Favorite class at UVA and why?</h3>
										<p>
											   Diff Eq the best class I've taken so far. It's one of the most rewarding classes I've ever taken because whenever I put crazy hours into it, the concepts would just click. I learned a lot of math in this class, but I also learned how to be a better student because of it. I took an L first semester with Multi, so getting to do well in Diff Eq and knowing that I deserved to do well was one of the best feelings I've had.

											<h3>What did you eat today?</h3>
										<p>
											 Today, I had a big double cheeseburger tray with a chicken quesadilla and fries from Cookout. There's literally three Cookouts within 20 minutes of my house, so it's not hard to find the motivation to go for a Cookout run.
