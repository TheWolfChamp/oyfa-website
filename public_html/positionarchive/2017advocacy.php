											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  The Advocacy committee is meant to stand up for Filipino culture, 
											  especially with a mission to bring more awareness to the often overlooked 
											  issues that Filipinos and Filipino-Americans face everyday. 
											  In addition, as a "mestiza cana" with over half my family overseas, 
											  I usually have to discover aspects about Filipino life on my own rather 
											  than depend on my family to teach me; as an Advocacy chair, 
											  I hope to cultivate my initiative to learn about life in the 
											  Philippines from a side hobby to something more sophisticated.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 At the very end of my first Barrio, when everyone came to the 
											 stage and sang the Good Ol' Song before breaking to go 
											 serve up some food!

											<h3>What is your favorite childhood memory?</h3>
										<p>
											    One time in middle school we took a trip to a field state park and went rafting down a river. 
												The class was divided into 3 river raft things. 
												I ended up in a raft with my crush (NICE) and all the supervising moms 
												that came along (not so nice). Since we all had like 0 experience with 
												boats and 0 strength (besides the dude I liked), we ended up paddling in 
												circles and were left behind. When we finally got the rhythm of it and were 
												on our way, we were so fast we were able to overtake the other two boats, 
												beat everyone to the other end of the river, and rest up a few minutes 
												before the others reached us. I'll never forget the hot sun, the water 
												splashes, and the laughs.

											<h3>What is one food you would want other people to try? Why?</h3>
										<p>
											   小笼包/Xiaolongbao/Soup dumplings!!!!! I had these for the first time when 
											   I visited Shanghai for the first time and they are AMAZING. When you bite 
											   into that little steamed bun and you're welcomed with a pleasant cascade of 
											   soup and meats and vegetable into your mouth, it's like a little preview of 
											   heaven. If you ever get the chance to go to China or Taiwan, make sure you 
											   get soup dumplings at least once (altho lez be real, you can't eat them just 
											   once) because they're not nearly as good here in the States, even at well known 
											   dim sum restaurants like Din Tai Fung.

											<h3>What is something you are passionate about?</h3>
										<p>
												Learning languages! In elementary school through mid high school, language 
												requirements were just another chore to me, plus I figured I wasn't smart 
												enough to ever actually master a language. But after some rough times (aaahh 
												teenage drama), I discovered that teaching myself vocabulary in another language 
												was the only thing that really distracted me and cheered me up. In about half a 
												year, I taught myself [extremely] basic Dutch and dedicated more time to the 
												Chinese class I was in. So far, it's paying off - I've had two opportunities to 
												go to China since then!
