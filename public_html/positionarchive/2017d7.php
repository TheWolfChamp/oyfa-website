											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 I ran for this position because I wanted to have an impact in OYFA and on 
											 a larger scale. D7 gave me the opportunity to meet the other Filipino Organizations 
											 and reflect on our place as Filipinos within our society. I knew I wanted to work 
											 with the other organizations and representatives to learn more about them and how 
											 we are supposed to work as a group to show the Filipino culture and identity.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											FAMILY WEEEEEEEEEK. When we finally found out who our Bigs were and came 
											together as an organization to enjoy spending time together; it was such a surreal time. 
											It was a time I'll always remember because I felt welcomed. I knew from that moment forward 
											that these CRAZY people (and I mean these people who I didn't even know) were going to be my 
											support system throughout the year. It was during this week that I realized that OYFA was 
											more than just "some other organization to join;" it was my comfort, my motivation, and my family.

												<h3>How would you plan your perfect day?</h3>

											  I would want to hang out with my best friends, by the beach, eating lots of food and FUNNEL CAKE (fun fact: I love funnel cake) while in my Eno taking a nap or reading a book.

											<h3>What is one goal you are working towards now?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I want to work on being more self-confident. If you feel confident, then you act with confidence. And when you act with confidence, everything falls into place. There is no point in putting yourself down and comparing yourself to the unrealistic. I want to give myself the opportunity to grow and find my vibe.

											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											   What gravitated me to the position was the opportunity to meet and network with 
											   students from different schools within District 7.  Often you would feel like you 
											   are stuck in this UVA/OYFA bubble and I think this position can allow you and others 
											   to go out and explore other Fil-Am organizations outside of UVA.

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>

										<p>
											 I HAVE SO MANY.  My favorite OYFA memories often happen on nights when everyone just push 
											 away their responsibilities, let loose and enjoy each other's companies.   BUT IF I HAD TO 
											 PICK ONE, it would probably Barrio.

										<p>
											  DO WHAT YOU LOVE/ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT.  This advice will not only bring success into your life but also happiness.  After going 
											  through my first year at the university, I noticed a stark difference between being here and being in high school.  In college, 
											  you get to pursue what you are really interested about without the distraction of enforced ideas.  High school emphasizes the idea of
											  a paved, strict path of learning: AKA you pretty much take the same classes as everyone, with the difficulty of said classes as the 
											  only thing that differentiates you from your peers. As a result, high schools saps any intellectual vigor students potentially have.   
											  In contrast, college is a time in life where you are given extensive resources to pursue what you like to do.  You have the choice of 
											  sticking to a predetermined path OR breaking the status quo to your heart's desire and creating your own path.  You do what you want to do.  
											  MORAL OF THE STORY:  DO WHAT YOU LOVE/ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT AND DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR IT.

											<h3>What is one goal you are working towards now?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  Lately, I've been waking up really late in the day, probably due to the lack of responsibilities I have over the summer, so I've made it my 
											  goal to wake up 8AM everyday (I have not made any progress in fulfilling this goal lmao).  Also, after reading my answers to these questions, 
											  I need to set up a goal of abating my use of parentheses.

											<h3>What is something you are passionate about?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  I LOVE LEARNING.  I know I sound nerdy af but I truly do enjoy learning about new things. Just this summer, I spent the past few weeks understanding
											  financial modeling and how it is used to find the valuation of an investment through multiple analyses, such as DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW AND COMPARATIVE 
											  COMPANY ANALYSIS (ZOMG BUTTERFLIES).  Also, after I graduated high school, I allocated a good amount of time emailing (pestering) professors at the
											  university about any questions I have with their specialties (I highly encourage doing this because they are usually enthusiastic about talking about what
											  they do, plus you learn new things). So pretty much I just enjoy the idea of waking up everyday knowing that I hold the power of knowing more about 
											  the world around me.
