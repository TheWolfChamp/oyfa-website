											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											To me, Membership seemed like the best way to directly give back and support an org that was a HUGE part of my first year at UVA. Interacting with different people and welcoming both new and old members into the OYFAm was/is a task I believe I can really pour myself into.

											<h3>What does OYFA mean to you?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											For me, being in OYFA means being comfortable. It's a group of people with whom I can let my guard down and just be myself. To add to that, I also feel like if I ever have to leave or "disappear" for weeks on end for whatever reason, the friends I've made will make it easy to pick up right where we left off - that's the kind of relationship I treasure, but haven't necessarily found elsewhere at UVA.

											<h3>What is something you are passionate about?</h3>
										<p>
											 Luhhh music. I like to sing and play guitar in my spare time (so like never).

											<h3>What did you eat today?</h3>

											I don't remember. Probably mangoes

											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I've always loved getting to know people around me. I've also always loved spending time with my fellow OYFAns. Membership was something I wouldn't mind spending countless hours on because I knew that I'd be working directly towards making our members happy. I wanted to give back to all the people that made my first-year experience the best as well as create meaningful relationships between our babies and returning members. All the events, pairings, and duties, ask anyone, I'm so excited for all of it!

											<h3>What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											OYFAssassins. So thrilling, so entertaining, so amazing. There are so many crazy memories and I actually started making some of my really close friends through scheming with them lmao. Except Abigail Hoang, she killed me. I can never forgive her for that.

											<h3>If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</h3>
										<p>
											The best superpower for me is definitely telepathy (mind reading). It's not a flashy power that will expose my identity, but it is such a powerful power. I would love to be able to always understand what others want and have so much extra knowledge about the people around me.

											<h3>Would you like to be famous? For what reason?</h3>
										<p>
											 I'd like to be famous! Not for something viral or silly though, it has to be some type of Iron Man-level famous. I would want to use fame to actually expose important issues to the media and to help be a positive guiding influence.
