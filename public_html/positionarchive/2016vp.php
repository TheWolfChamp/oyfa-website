											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  I ran for VP because I wanted to challenge myself. After holding two very different positions, I thought my experience would be helpful to both Board and Council. I wanted to see how I could use the skills I have learned and the experiences I have had so far at UVA to help guide the leaders of OYFA.

											<h3>What does OYFA mean to you?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 To me, OYFA means balance. When I first came to UVA, I really struggled finding a balance in life. In high school I kept myself busy with extracurriculars, but when I got to UVA I didn't know what to do with all my time. I didn't do well in school because I wasn't able to find a balance between work and play. I found a good group of friends in OYFA that helped me find this balance and learn how to manage my schedule. I was able to play sports, go to fun events, volunteer, AND learn about Filipino culture. Being in OYFA and holding leadership positions has really shaped by college experience, I feel like I would be very lost if I hadn't joined.

											<h3>Favorite class at UVA and why</h3>
										<p>
											    Sociology of Self. I liked how Professor Dudaronak presented theories and the ones she chose to teach. We read many articles that were helpful in my major and I actually enjoyed learning about theory - woah.

											<h3>Describe your perfect day</h3>
										<p>
											  Eating three meals in three different countries. I would want to wake up on an island in the Philippines, eat spam, eggs and rice, and lay on the beach and drink out of a coconut. I would want to have lunch in Italy and eat some good pasta and roam around. I would want to have a starry dinner on a rooftop in Paris, where I could see the Eiffel tower and eat escargot (and other french food). Annnddd maybe end up at a dance club in Spain to learn how to salsa the night away.
