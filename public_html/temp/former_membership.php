			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
I chose to run for Membership because OYFA did so much for me in just one year, so I wanted to use my talents in a way that would allow me give back to OYFA and leave a positive mark in the best way I can. I love meeting people and making others excited about OYFA so Membership was the job for me :D 
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
To me OYFA has been more than a family away from home. It's been a place of personal growth, a place where I've been challenged to leave my comfort zone, try out new things, and meet so many amazing individuals! I never imagined how quickly I would become attached to the organization and the people in it, and how much I would learn and experience because of them. Joining OYFA has been one of the best decisions I've made at my time here at UVA, and I'm enjoying every moment of it!

			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
By the time acceptance letters were being sent out, I'd decided UVA was my #1 choice because I really liked grounds, it was known as one of the best schools in the country, and I liked that it was not too far away from home (703!). I wasn't 100% sure about my choice until I got here and started getting involved, meeting new people, and learning a lot.

			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
I NEVER HAVE A GOOD ANSWER FOR THIS QUESTION. Someone musical, who likes to dance, and who can be quirky but awesome at the same time lol. Probably a YouTuber because I know them better than I know actors/celebs haha.

			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
I ran for membership because I want others to be able to share the same enthusiasm and feeling of belonging that I found during my first year with OYFA. College is a place for people to learn more about themselves, and there isn't a better group of motivated people out there to help you grow and support you than the people in OYFA. I want to help others be the best that they can be, and meeting people and showing them what OYFA is about is a great way to start!
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
For me, OYFA was a group of people that really showed me just how much someone can accomplish if you put your mind to it. I never would have thought I would enjoying what college has to offer if it wasn't for having such supportive and determined friends around me, encouraging to push my limits. In that sense, OYFA has become my family here in Charlottesville. They're always there for you, and they're a group you can always come back to, no matter where you end up.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
Though UVA wasn't originally my first choice, I can honestly say I don't have any regrets about choosing to come here. I came to the decision attend college here because I felt that it offered me the best chance to grow and develop, in addition to being a pretty sweet bargain for the quality of education you get here. I realized I didn't want to go too far away from home, so Charlottesville and Mr. Jefferson's university became the obvious choice for me. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
Liam Neeson, hands down. He's probably ten times the person I'd ever be, but I really admire his calm and friendly personality both on and off-screen. Plus if "Taken" is any indication, he's quite the family man, which is something I value very much.
