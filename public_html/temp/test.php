<strong>1. What was the reason you joined OYFA in the first place?</strong>
I joined OYFA because I really enjoyed how welcoming all the members were to me when I was a first year. I made so many great friends through OYFA and they became my family :)

<strong>2. What is your favorite flavor of frozen yogurt from Sweet Frog, and how that flavor most represents you?</strong>
I like just plain chocolate, it's nice and simple and sweet :)

<strong>3. What was your most favorite OYFA event and why?</strong>
My most favorite OYFA event is the OYFA field day. Its cool cause I love all kinds of field day events and it's a good way to bond with your family :)

<strong>4. If you were stuck on a foreign island filled with violent natives ready to kill you, forcing you to entertain them with a dance from Barrio, which dance would you choose and why? Last year's first year modern -- the class of 2015 is the best!</strong>
I would get all the guys around me to dance the Igorot, cause that would make the natives bow down to the Igorot awesomeness :P

<strong>1. What was the reason you joined OYFA in the first place?</strong>
I joined OYFA because of the awesome people I met during my first year.They were so welcoming, and being a first year student without many friends in the University, it was exactly what I needed. So long story short, join OYFA = make great friends!

<strong>2. What is your favorite flavor of frozen yogurt from Sweet Frog, and how that flavor most represents you?</strong>
My favorite frozen yogurt from sweet frog is most definitely Cookies n' Creme. It represents me because I'm sweet like cookies and fresh like creme fresh and I'm chocolate.

<strong>3. What was your most favorite OYFA event and why?</strong>
My favorite OYFA event is BARRIO!!! I'm sure a lot of the other council and board members say this too, but Barrio has a special place in my heart because it's the time where you physically see the passion that OYFA inspires. Where everyone comes together, where we show the bonds we all have with each other, where our OYFAmily is its absolute strongest.

<strong>4. If you were stuck on a foreign island filled with violent natives ready to kill you, forcing you to entertain them with a dance from Barrio, which dance would you choose and why? Last year's first year modern -- the class of 2015 is the best!</strong>
Igorot because I'll be oiled up and I'll slide my way out of the village and then fashion my loin cloth and bamboo stick into a shelter and live out the rest of my days as a nomadic hunter running from a tribe of crazy natives that I don't even know why they hate me so much, I'm sweet like a cookie and fresh like creme fresh.
