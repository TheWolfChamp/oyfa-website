			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
After going through Culturefest and Barrio Fiesta, I couldn't help but notice how everyone bonded and enjoyed each others' company. As I saw these friendships develop, I knew that I wanted to help foster these bonds and create an environment where people can build new friendships all while having fun and learning about the Filipino culture. Despite being a big time-commitment, I find that this position is the best way for me to give back to the organization that has always made me feel at home, here at the University of Virginia.			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
I really enjoy how OYFA creates a strong familial space for which people can bond and make friends; that's the reason why I love OYFA and why I joined! Through thick and thin, the people you meet and befriend in OYFA will always have your back and will always be there to support you through times of sorrow. It is through these bonds that make OYFA enjoyable for everyone.			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
Ever since I was young, I have always been involved with music; as expected, music became one of my passions. I love playing my piano when I have some down time, but I also enjoy playing the clarinet, bass clarinet, euphonium, and baritone. I love to compose random pieces of music as well as just sitting back and listening to music. Nonetheless, music is something that I will always turn to and I can't see a life without music. Music has molded me into the person I am today. Music is not a hobby, but a lifestyle...a passion.			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
Not trying to be creepy, but I wished I had the power of invisibility...you know for reconnaissance purposes, gathering information and all. However, it also comes in handy if I were in a sticky situation and needed to leave with haste (not that I would be).			</div>
