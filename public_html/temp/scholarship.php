			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
I ran for scholarship chair because I want to promote academic excellence within OYFA and really give back to this organization by raising funds for the OYFA Excellence Scholarship.			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
I love the familial aspect of OYFA. I have met some of my best friends here and I couldn't imagine life without them! OYFA is an awesome organization. It's filled with great people that I find myself spending most of my time with, hehe. There's always someone to eat with, go out with, or just do nothing with. Simply put, we're the best :P
			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
I am passionate about nursing. I can't wait to become a pediatric nurse (and further down the road, a pediatric nurse practitioner) and make a difference in people's lives, one child at a time. They are the sweetest and to see them smile warms my heart! 			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
To never be tired; My 3rd year has wiped me out, LOL. I need all the energy to do all the fun things hehe. Maybe to poof food onto my plate out of thin air, that'd be cool. In addition to that, to eat all the things and stay fit aka never get fat, YAS LOL. That's a super power right? HAHAH</div>

			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
Since joining OYFA, I've made some of the most memorable experience with the most passionate, driven, and diverse group of people I've come to know. I couldn't imagine how my college career would be like without some of the people I've met through OYFA and the experiences I've had in this org. As a student here on scholarship, I know just how important every dollar is when it comes to paying for college. I couldn't think of any other way to give back to an organization that has given me so much over the past two years than to serve as its scholarship chair.			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
I love how diverse OYFA is. You meet all sorts of people from all walks of life. You have people from different states, different countries, different ethnicities; everyone has different backgrounds, interests, hobbies, likes and yet we all can still come together as one big family. OYFA is welcoming to all people and everyone can find their own niche within the organization.			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
Ice cream.

Just kidding. To be honest, I'm still trying to figure out what my passion is in life. I love helping people so hopefully I can do more with that in the future.			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
The ability to shoot Chipotle lasers out of my eyes.</div>
