			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
						I thought it would be the perfect position for me because it combined art and OYFA--two things I am passionate about. And because of that, I saw it not as a job but rather a creative outlet that would allow me to give back to the organization that eased my transition to UVA.<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
						Culturefest! It's something all first years should experience.	<br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
						There are so many things to look forward to this upcoming year! Barrio, serving on council, making new friends, spoiling my Little... the list just goes on and on! But the thing I am looking forward to the most would be helping incoming members create unforgettable memories because OYFA definitely helped make my first year at UVA memorable.   <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
						Rory from Gilmore Girls because she's smart, passionate, driven, and classy. Those are qualities that I truly admire.

			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
					I've always believed that publicity is easily one of the most important aspects for a strong and growing organization.  How do I know this?  In my sophomore year of high school, I forgot to put up flyers for a club and no one showed up for the meeting :( However since then, I have learned a lot about successful branding using the power of graphic design and social media.  I wanted to combine my large enthusiasm for the organization that has done so much for me with what I've learned throughout the years.  <br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
					My favorite OYFA memory so far would definitely be the fall Big/Little Week as it was essentially the induction of the 2019 babies to OYFAmilia! I loved seeing everyone in OYFA competing and bonding to become the families we know today.  I won't forget how crazy and exhausting that Ball Chasing game was during Field Day, nor the amazing feeling when I was finally reunited with Filipino food during Family Dinner.  Also I still feel the Bravehearts to this day.  <br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
					"I am honestly so amazed on how long I felt I have known OYFA, although it's only been a semester.  All my fellow babies seem to have grown so much since August, and I am looking forward to what amazing things everyone will do here on Grounds. Event wise tho... BARRIO HYPE! " <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
					I'd probably be Ash Ketchum from the Pokemon series.  He has a very simple goal: To become the best like no one ever was.  Plus he gets to live in such a great world that revolves around Pokemon battles instead of Stat homework. Also he has achieved eternal youth, much wow.
