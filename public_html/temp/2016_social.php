			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
						OYFA is awesome and has done so much for me at this point during my college career and I wanted to give back. Being social chair, I get to use some of my amazing creativity and ideas to plan some fun events that everyone can go to. While parties and getting absolutely trashed is fun, dry events can be hype, too, and I wanted a chance to show people that.<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
						Alright, I have to set the scene first: it's Barrio dress rehearsal. O-hill forum. Day before Barrio. It has to be like one in the morning, but jesus it's loud. Alums and all the upperclassmen are cheering their literal souls out. It's the first years' time slot to practice their modern dances. They start and everything goes great- no mess-ups. Tinikling. Then boys. Then partners. Then girls. And then everyone. The first years were on their way to steamrolling through the everyone dance just like they did the other dances when suddenly the music shuts off. But it too hype now to stop; everyone and their mother started to sing the rest of the song. "HOUSE PARTY! PARTY!" The first years finished out the dance. That had to be the hypest moment of my first year. <br>
			<h4>3. If you had 24 hours left to live and 100 dollars to spend, what would you do with it? What about if you had 10000 dollars?</h4>
						Buy a huge bag of candy. I'll proceed to eat said candy for 24 hours, complementing the candy with video games, movies, and other fun activities. I could buy like 100 bags of candy with $10000. That'd be too much candy though. You can only eat so much in a day. Probably travel somewhere cool. Like Oregon.<br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
						Archer from Archer. Who wouldn't want to be the world's greatest spy?

			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
					I knew from the very beginning that OYFA was the right club for me, so I was determined to become even more involved.  I also always enjoyed going to OYFA events, especially events with FREE FOOD, so I put the two together and decided to run for Social. It's honestly really rewarding to see other people enjoy themselves ,and being able to plan and come up with events is pretty cool too.<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
					Barrio for sure.I participated in 6 different dances, but my favorite was Igorot. Prior to Barrio, I spent 2 months eating mostly chicken breasts and salads and doing cardio ,so I can look good oiled up in a thong while holding a bamboo stick.  Worth. I was also known as "Barrio Fest Chin" during that time frame.<br>
			<h4>3. Favorite class at UVA and why</h4>
					I have a love/hate relationship with Chinese. There is a ridiculous amount of work for the course, but it is very rewarding. It's like being inside of a dark tunnel; there is light at the other side. However, the tunnel is like 100 gazillion miles long. 10/10 would recommend<br>
			<h4>4. Describe your perfect day</h4>
					Wake up, lift with Chris, celebrate lunch with Chris day, eat celebrate dinner with Chris Day, and then sleep.  It doesn't take much to make me happy.
