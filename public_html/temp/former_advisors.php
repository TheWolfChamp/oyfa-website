			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
I applied to be a Student Advisor because after losing out for the OYFA presidency last semester, I felt that the experiences and knowledge I had acquired in not only my two years on Council as Membership/Social but also from the advice given to me by previous presidents of OYFA in my bid for president had prepared me for a position to help OYFA from an all-around perspective. As a Student Advisor, I could potentially have an impact on every facet of the organization.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
OYFA is responsible for the best college experience I could have ever imagined. Best friends, lifelong bonds, unforgettable Barrio performances, the triumph and heartbreak of IM sports, community service, OYFA had it all.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
Staying in-state was a given for financial reasons--I got into UC-Berkeley but my parents weren't about to let me go to California haha. So deciding between UVA and Virginia Tech, it was a no-brainer. I loved Grounds and the environment that UVA had to offer over Blacksburg.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
Charlie Day. I love his high-pitched voice and the way he just goes insane in some scenes, so I think he could pull off my personality pretty well!

			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
In the past, I have taken both council and board positions. I felt that I had a lot of advice and suggestions to give based on my past experiences, and I just like giving it out haha. I thought it would also be awesome to help guide everyone through their college life because I'm old and thus am wise because i've been through it all (just kidding...about the wise part...kind of). 
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
OYFA is the first place where I felt really comfortable. It might be hard to imagine, but I was a super awkward first year that didn't know what was going on and missed home so much. There were so many friendly people and such a good connection between the members of OYFA that made me feel like I found a niche for myself at UVA. 			
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
Well, I actually didn't want to go to UVA. My first choice was the University of Notre Dame, but have you seen those tuition prices?! I probably would have to rob 10 banks and sell my parents' belongings before I can afford to go there. At first I didn't think that I would like UVA that much, but I'm glad that I kept an open mind. This place is beautiful, fun, has some of the MOST awesome people ever, and I couldn't see myself going anywhere else.

			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
I suck at answering questions like this because, let's be honest, I would like to play myself (I consider myself a somewhat decent looking actress). However, if I could choose, I would want Emma Stone to play me. I'm pretty dorky, a little on the snarky sarcastic side, a dash of goofiness, and she's definitely awesome. Like me.
