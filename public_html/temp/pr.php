<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
I've always admired the OYFA flyers, and I wanted to help contribute to an organization that I loved. Since I have been exposed to art throughout my life, it is something that I'm familiar with. I believed that I had a good eye for design and that I could bring my creativity into making awesome flyers for OYFA!			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
OYFA has one of the most welcoming people!!! They really make you feel like you belong, and they ARE SO MUCH FUN. They can be the craziest people sometimes, but they are really the BEST. Also, OYFAns love to eat...... so I can expect some food when I'm with them :)			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
I'm pretty sure that everyone knows the answer to this question....PIZZA. But I guess if I had to pick something more legitimate, it would be art.			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
Definitely telekinesis cause I'm pretty lazy lmao.

			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
I'm excited about OYFA, so I ran for PR because I want to get everyone else in the UVa community excited about OYFA, too. I also enjoy being technologically creative with designing and video-making, so the position really called out to me. Jump for jOYFA!			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
Since first year, OYFA has provided me with a family at my home away from home. A really really awesome family with so many different backgrounds, personalities, and experiences to share. My OYFamily has definitely helped shape my college experience for which I am infinitely grateful :)			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
I'm passionate for food and traveling, especially when I get to explore and experience both at the same time! 			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
This is a toughie! I'm struggling with three, which are 1) having a pitless and unexpandable stomach or maybe just no stomach at all, so that I could just eat everything and my body would be as happy as I am, 2) being able to read minds because I'm super intrigued by what and how people are thinking, and 3) being able to fly because who doesn't want to fly?
Definitely thinking of more, but I already listed three and can't decide on one... Is decisiveness a superpower? Maybe I should've just said that... womp	</div>
