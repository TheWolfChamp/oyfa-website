			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
						Like most members, OYFA has become an important part of my college experience. I wanted to become an officer to help be a bigger part of this organization, and webmaster seemed like the best fit for me. As a CS major, I think learning html and web development is a useful way to apply my involvement in OYFA to my academic career and vice versa.<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
						Igorot.	<br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
						Meeting new faces, reuniting with old ones, making memories, working on council, long nights having fun, long nights talking, long nights studying/coding, being disappointed with another mediocre Redskins season, you get the point <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
						I would be Jim Halpert from The Office. Who wouldn't want to work for Michael Scott in a mid-size paper company, spend all my free time pulling elaborate pranks on Dwight Schrute, and start a family with the love of my life in the Scranton-- what? the electric city!
