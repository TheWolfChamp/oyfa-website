			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
			OYFA did so much for me in terms of making me feel welcome to the university as a first-year, so I knew that I wanted to be involved in continuing that atmosphere for the future babies. I also wanted to shine light on aspects of OYFA that needed attention brought to them, like our participation in D7 and FIND as well as our obligation to promote and support the university's A/APA community.			<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
			My favourite OYFA memory has to be the morning of CultureFest 2014. Standing in the stairwell with all the performers and the culture chairs and feeling that sense of unity, accomplishment, and excitement right before we went onstage. It was then that I felt the most connected with my year, the Flawless Class of 2018.				<br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
I'm looking forward to what I can bring to OYFA this year as D7 chair: Olympics, Dialogue (potentially in our own district this year), Conference (if it doesn't get scheduled on the same day as Barrio again), and a whole host of other D7 events which I want our organization to enjoy and support.<br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
Initially, I thought "Alphonse Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood", but then I realized that I would have to deal with not eating, not sleeping, and a horrible past, so nope. Instead, I'll probably go with Ash Ketchum from Pokemon, mainly because who wouldn't want to travel the world with their two best friends and an army of pokemon? That's the dream, yo.

			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
				I want to get OYFA genuinely excited about about D7 and FIND.  This organization provides awesome opportunities to meet new people and travel to other schools, and I can't wait to get OYFA more involved in this! <br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
				Igorot 2015, easy.  I still don't know how I made that jump onto the stage though.  <br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
				I'm looking forwards to FIND and D7 events, especially Dialogue and Conference.  Also, traveling to other schools and seeing their culture shows sounds awesome.  I can't wait to see the awesome stuff other D7 schools have put together.<br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
				I would be Frank Underwood.  Or any Kevin Spacey character really.  I guess I just want to be Kevin Spacey.
