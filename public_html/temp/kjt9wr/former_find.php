			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
My brother and sister were both members of FACT @ VCU, so I ended up meeting and hanging out with a lot of FACToids. If I hadn't become friends with all them, I highly doubt I would have joined OYFA. As a first year, my favorite events were always the D7 events where we were all brought together to strengthen our bonds as a district. I love meeting new people and supporting our fellow Filipino organizations in their endeavors, so I decided it would only make sense to run for the position that spoke so clearly to the things that I love.

			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
Oxygenated Yiddish Falafels of America.

			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
In-state tuition, and I didn't get into Columbia University. HAHA that's the most honest answer I could give, but honestly I'm so glad I ended up here at UVA. So many of us are bent on going to the Ivy Leagues for the prestige of it. However, you pay a ridiculous amount of money to feel sub-par for your 4 years whereas at UVA, I pay in-state tuition for the #1 PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN AMERICA, AYEE! UVA is a university that has a student body that is extremely diverse in terms of identity, but in terms of ambition, we were all the trailblazers in our high schools, and we continually strive to achieve. Attending UVA was the best decision I could have made for myself.

			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
Well there is a movie made about my life. You should go check it out. It's called Aladdin.

Hehe but if I had to choose someone to play me, I'd choose Miranda Kerr, because then I could be portrayed as tall and Australian: everything I will never be. D':

			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
Like everyone else on board/council, I really just wanted to give back to OYFA, and I figured that with the resources and skills that I'm equipped with, running for FIND just made the most sense.  Many of my close friends from home are really involved in the Filipino-American student organizations in other District VII schools, and through these connections from home, I've been able to network and have established ties with college students all across the state.  I feel as though it is my duty to use these connections to help get OYFAns out there to do the same.

			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
"...Magtagumpay, Pinaroroonan, Paglalakbay, Pagkakasama..."			
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
After having heard back from all of the colleges that I applied to, I was caught between two schools- UVA and UC Berkeley.  At the time, my heart was really telling me that I belonged at Berkeley, that I belonged by the beautiful bay and on the west coast.  My wallet and my parents, however, thought differently, and when it came down to it, the nice in-state tuition that everyone raves about really fueled my decision to attend UVA.  Looking back, though, I'm really glad it did, and I'm really glad I'm here.  The rich tradition, gorgeous architecture and enormous appreciation for education on Grounds make waking up every morning to head to class a true privilege.

			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
Donald Glover because he and I are pretty much the same person.
