			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
						I was always in awe of how Culture unites our fellow OYFAns  not only through our filipino heritage but also through performances. Culturefest, and Barrio really solidified my love for this organization and the friends that I have made throughout my OYFA experience!  I decided to run because I wanted to make future and current OYFAns find their place in our large and mighty family, and learn some dance moves along the way!<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
						My favorite memory would have to be all of our 1st year Barrio practices! I've gotten to know so many wonderful and passionate people throughout Barrio season and I am so thankful for it! I especially treasure all the tinkling practices at Mem. Although the AC wouldn't work most of the time, and the tinkling sticks kept hitting our feet, WE SURVIVED! 	<br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
						I'm looking forward to getting to know our new babies, as well as making irreplaceable memories with everyone! I'd like to think that every year is always special and unpredictable so I'm ready for whatever comes! Look out for Barrio (!!), it'll be our best one yet! (Not being bias at all hehe)  <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
						I would be Peggy Carter from Captain America. Because she kicks butt and because she's the love interest of Captain America (Chris Most Beautiful Man Alive Evans).

			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
					I've always been really into learning about my culture and spreading awareness of it to other people. Running for this position gave me the best opportunity to do so, since my cochair and I would be responsible OYFA's biggest cultural showcase. 	<br> <br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
					Every late night study sessions with OYFA peeps will continue to be one of my fondest memories as a first year. I don't have a favourite quite yet, since I can't possibly count out the memories to be made in the next three years. But getting to know people and just straight out enjoying company is a great feeling.  <br> <br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
					I'm looking forward to Barrio and basically every event OYFA has planned for the upcoming school year! I also look forward to new members and old ones. <br> <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
					I'd be the Master from Doctor Who- a female version, of course. It's fun terrorising your enemy and having immortality. Plus, I'd have a British accent which is cool, I guess. Eh, I like villains.
