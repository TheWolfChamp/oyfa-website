			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
OYFA has done a lot for me these past three years. It has brought me my closest friends, my big brothers, my fondest memories, my loves, and of course my culture. Now as a fourth year, it's time to give back by sharing my experiences and advice to all of you. Being a student advisor is a great way for me to get even closer to the organization as well as pass down everything i've learned.			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
I absolutely love how every member in OYFA is willing to help others and show support. There have been many occasions where OYFANS group together to study, see a dance performance, and acapella shows to display our love for each other. You can always count own someone in OYFA to be there for you at your best and at your worst, which is probably the greatest feeling in the world. 			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
I love working with kids. I've spend a lot of my time volunteering and interacting with children all throughout high school and college. Being in a college setting, you tend to forget other generations. Most of the time I see either really old professors or students my age; not really anyone younger and I miss that. Children bring joy to me because they are so curious and care free. I would love to bring that aspect to UVA students where we can take a break from planning our futures and enjoy the present.			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
I've always wanted to fly. It would be like going on an amusement park ride every single day and you could get to and from places without a problem!			</div>

			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
During my second year, I held the position of one of OYFA's Public Relations chairs, which kept me quite busy. Looking towards my third year, I decided to prioritize my studies and not run for another council position. After having that time to reflect, I realized that I still had more opportunities to give back to the organization before my time at the University would be over. OYFA has been a major contributor to my experience at UVa and I wanted to do my best to help the org continue to influence and inspire students at the University.			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
A significant draw towards OYFA for me is the familial atmosphere. It has always provided me with that cliche "home away from home" while at school. The relationships that I have made through OYFA are very important to me and are what bring me back to the organization again and again.			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
One thing that I am passionate about is: Family. My definition of family extends from my mother and father, to my cousins, to my friends. I would be nothing without my family and they truly complete me.			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
If I could have any superpower it would be Omnilinguilism (the ability to understand any form of language). I have always admired anyone who could speak more than one language as I am only capable of fluently communicating in English. I also have a quirk for imitating/replicating accents or pronunciation of other languages. Although there are some people out there with less complete versions of this power, it is still "super" to me.			</div>
