			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
					I just remember how welcoming all the OYFAn's were when I was just beginning to join the organization at the beginning of my first year. My big, my family, and basically all of the other members made such an effort to get to know me, and it made all the difference for my time at UVA. So, I wanted to work to do the same for other new incoming members, and I knew that as membership chair I could make a big impact! 		<br>
			<h4>2. What is your favorite OYFA memory?</h4>
					I loved participating in Barrio this past year. Having helped choreograph and coordinate First Year Modern was a great experience that lasted the entire semester. I watched my class bond while also having an awesome time, and having it all come together for our biggest event of the year was the best.   <br>
			<h4>3. What are you looking forward most to this upcoming year?</h4>
					I'm looking forward to all the new members that are coming in this upcoming year.  <br>
			<h4>4. If you could be a character from any film or TV series, who would you be?</h4>
					I would want to be Arya from Game of Thrones.
