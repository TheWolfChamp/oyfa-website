			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
				I love OYFA, and I love photography! After having an awesome first year with OYFA, I felt like the best way for me to give back to the organization was to document the memories OYFA creates for everyone. 
			<br>
			<h4>2. Favorite OYFA merch?</h4>
				Always frockets<br>
			<h4>3. Favorite class at UVA and why</h4>
				ARTS 2610 (Intro to Drawing I). As an E-School student, I didn't really know what to expect from a drawing class, but it's easily my favorite class period. The professor (Professor Bernstein) is one of the most caring and understanding people I've ever met. Professor Bernstein makes it her goal for every student in the class to finish the semester with new perspectives and appreciations for everything.<br>
			<h4>4. If you could have any super power, what would it be and why?</h4>
				Flying. Walking takes up too much effort
