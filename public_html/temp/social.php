			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
Being social chair interested me because event planning is pretty much what I want to do with my life. Planning and organizing may not always be the most fun job, but I love seeing people enjoy themselves when events come together in the end. Also, I want to be a wedding planner when I grow up (can I still use that phrase?), so planning events for OYFA seemed like a rewarding outlet for my personal skills and interests.			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
The people! OYFA has introduced me to some of the coolest, nicest, most genuine people ever. While all the official events are fun too, it's the impromptu real talks and spontaneous late night food runs that I love the most.			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
Music! I can unashamedly say I kind of miss being in concert band ... Band camp, not so much. I like using Old Cabell's practice rooms sometimes to play flute and can kill time at home for hours learning songs on my keyboard from YouTube tutorials. I like basically all kinds of music, except for screamo (yes, even country ... everyone really should give it a try!). I think picking songs for movie scenes/soundtracks/trailers would be one of the coolest jobs ever.			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
Teleportation, hands down. More efficient than super speed and flying, plus I could satisfy all my wanderlust without all the airfare.</div>

			<strong>1. Why did you decide to run for this council position?</strong><br>
I decided to run for social chair since I loved how active OYFA was when I first joined.  I wanted to play an active role in how OYFA provides social events to its members.			<br>
			<strong>2. What do you enjoy most about OYFA?</strong><br>
The thing I enjoy most about OYFA is the diversity.  Diversity in not only race but personalities as well and how OYFA as a whole remains a tight knit family despite the differences among members.			<br>
			<strong>3. What is something you are passionate about?</strong><br>
The one thing that i a most passionate about is cooking.  I have been cooking since I was able to see above a stove and I constantly try new things in the  kitchen from new regional cuisines to the latest cooking fads/equipment.			<br>
			<strong>4. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</strong><br>
It would probably be to teleport anywhere in the world.  This would make keeping in touch with people and robbing banks super easy.</div>
