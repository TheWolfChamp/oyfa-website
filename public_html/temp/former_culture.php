			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
			After participating in CultureFest, I saw how everyone became such close friends and how much fun we had and it was definitely something I wanted to be a part of. Although it's one the most stressful and time-consuming positions, to me it just means that I'm giving as much as I can back to OYFA.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
			I used to be involved in a Filipino community back in my hometown, but I fell off in recent years. OYFA has brought back that sense of family, in addition to helping me find new best friends. I can't even imagine my life without OYFA's involvement now. It's defined my college experience.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
At first, UVA wasn't my first choice and I chose it based on the quality of education and the opportunities it offered above all else. However, within a few short weeks, Charlottesville felt like home and I never wanted to leave. I would be lying if I said OYFA and its members didn't play an important role in my falling in love with UVA. I can't believe that I ever wanted to go anywhere else!
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
I would want ME to play ME, of course! Why would you go see a movie about me not watch the one and only Leangelo Acuna? That's right, you wouldn't!

			<strong>1. Why did you run for this council position?</strong><br>
I've always loved planning and organizing events, so I thought being Culture chair was a perfect fit because I get to plan OYFA's biggest event Barrio Fiesta! I also really wanted to learn more about my culture, and being culture chair kinda forces me to explore information about the Philippines and teach others about it!			
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</strong><br>
 Always someone there to lend you a hand, give you support and make you laugh. Some of my best memories were made because of the organization and the members. Joining was something I'll never regret.        
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</strong><br>
Honestly, I didn't know much about this school when I applied. All I knew was that it was one of the best public universities in Virginia, which was pretty convincing to me. It wasn't til I actually stepped foot on the lawn that I thought "Wow, this is the perfect place for me".			
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</strong><br>
Drew Barymore. I know she's a little old, but I absolutely love how she can be hilarious  clumsy, and sophisticated all at the same time. She would be able to bring out both my silly and serious personality as well as make the audience think I'm cooler than I actually am.
