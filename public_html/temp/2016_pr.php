			<h4>1.  Why did you decide to run for this position?</h4>
					This committee is one of the best ways to get our message and brand out there. OYFA is a really special group and I want to be able to highlight that for the UVA community. <br>
			<h4>2. Favorite OYFA merch?</h4>
					The stuff that's yet to come(;  <br>
			<h4>3. What did you do/plan to do this summer?</h4>
					I participated in the Summer Medical & Dental Education Program at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. It's an amazing program filled with shadowing, guest speakers and classes better prepare you for the MCAT/DAT. If you are considering pre-health, definitely apply! After the 6 week program, I went back to work because college and living is expensive. <br>
			<h4>4. Describe your perfect day</h4>
					75 degree weather with a slight breeze and cup of gelato in my hand while laying back on a hammock 3 feet off the ground.
