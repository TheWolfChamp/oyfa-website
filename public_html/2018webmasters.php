											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  OYFA has been my 2nd home ever since first year. I did social in the past 
											  and I returned this year to give back because I want to give back a little 
											  more. I decided to do webmaster because as a CS major, I have the means of 
											  making the website into something much more.

											<h3>What is one goal you want to accomplish by the end of the year?
</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 I want to hit big enough numbers on my lifts that would classify me as an elite lifter.

												<h3>Favorite class at UVA and why?
</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											   I have a love/hate relationship with Chinese. There 
											   is a ridiculous amount of work involved, but it is very 
											   rewarding especially since I learned a great deal about my culture from it.

												If you were stuck in an Island and could only eat one food the entire time, what would you choose?

												</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											Probably chicken because they can lay eggs meaning that I can actually have two foods which would be chicken and eggs.

												<h3>If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?
</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											The power to eat anything and have it be perfect nutrition meaning I won't get fat. I'll then be able to bankrupt buffets.

											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I ran for this position because OYFA has helped me make a smooth transition into college.
											I felt that with my skillset, I could do something positive for this organization through the position of webmaster.
											Also, it is a huge troll to have your big be your cochair.

												<h3>Is water wet?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											    Salt is salty and it makes food salty. Therefore because water makes things wet it also has to be wet

												<h3>If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
												I would probably want the ability to make shadow clones like in Naruto. Not only would I have multiple versions of myself
												to complete homework, I would also gain the knowledge that each clone gains.

												<h3>If you were stuck in an Island and could only eat one food the entire time, what would you choose?
												</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											I would definitely bring galbi (Korean BBQ spare ribs). I wouldn't even care about being stranded on an island if I had Kalbi to be honest.
