											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  Growing up with a Filipino mother and an Afghan father, I struggled
											  with my cultural identity. However, when I came to UVA I found that I was
											  able to embrace the Filipino side of me within such a positive and welcoming 
											  community that I now consider family. I want to foster an environment where everyone 
											  can take that same kind of pride in their identities, whether it pertain to multiculturalism,
											  gender, being a first-generation student, or literally ANYTHING, as well as understand the meaning 
											  behind those identities through open discussions and education.

											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 As an individual, I am always looking for ways to grow and become
											 better educated on issues that may not affect me directly, but have the 
											 potential to in the future. The more I’ve become involved in OYFA and the more 
											 I’ve spent time with OYFAns, the more passionate I’ve become in applying that
											 growth amongst our members as a whole. With this, I truly believe in the educating
											 of our members to become more aware of situations that may impact them on Grounds,
											 as well as the importance of addressing their identities as Filipino-Americans or AAPI
											 in a PWI and how that may impact their experiences here at UVA in comparison to the "ideal" 
											 UVA experience. Although the original creation of OYFA was born out of a social nature, I feel
											 as if the changing political climate calls for a more refined side to OYFA in terms of being
											 involved and aware of what’s going on around us and in our community.

											<h3>If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?
											</h3>
										<p>
											  "If I could have any superpower, I'd probably want the ability to warp time in a non-detrimental way along with time travel. 
											  I can either be extremely indecisive or just be actin' a fool by actually making impulsive AF decisions—warping time and being 
											  able to travel through it would come in extremely handy when it comes to weighing out those decisions and experiencing the potential 
											  pros and cons. I also get suuuuuper nostalgic and ""in my feels"" when I think about past good times, go hoos, so it wouldn't hurt to relive 
											  those moments every once in a while ya feel. (okay, and tbh, have y'all heard of the game ""Life is Strange"" because that was kinda my inspo bye)"
