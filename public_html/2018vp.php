											<h3>Why did you decide to run for this position?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											  Oyfa has always meant so much to me. When I arrived at UVa, 
											  Oyfa immediately showed me its compassion as one of my strongest support systems.
											  As I observed Oyfa within its social scope, I noticed Oyfa's potential to become a major 
											  political force as well. I decided to run for Oyfa's Vice President to help Oyfa become not only
											  an inclusive community, but also a special stakeholder at the University for Asian American voices.

												<h3>If you were stuck in an Island and could only eat one food the entire time, what would you choose?
												</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
											   Salad! The varieties are endless. I also really love eating plant based so an island would be perfect for sustaining this type of diet.
